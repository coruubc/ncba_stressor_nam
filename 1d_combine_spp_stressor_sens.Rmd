# Summary

Stressor sensitivity is a very simplified version of stressor weights (see draft1 folder for complicated version).  Here, we will simply note whether a given species is sensitive to a given stressor, using the IUCN impact weights (i.e. non-negligible impact score), ranked as 0-3 (no, low, medium, high impact) for later differentiation if necessary.  For species with NA impact scores, we can imply sensitivity based on other fields, e.g. severity.  This version of sensitivity is not related to the range of exposure, as the weight calculation was doing.

Sensitivity will denote whether a species range overlapping a stressor range constitutes an impact.

# Methods

Gather processed sensitivity dataframes and combine into a single one.
```{r}

sens_gen <- read_csv(here('_output', sprintf('spp_sens_general_%s.csv', api_version)),
                     col_types = cols('iucn_sid' = 'i', 'code' = 'c'))
sens_fis <- read_csv(here('_output', sprintf('spp_sens_fishing_%s.csv', api_version)),
                     col_types = cols('iucn_sid' = 'i', 'code' = 'c'))
sens_cc  <- read_csv(here('_output', sprintf('spp_sens_climate_%s.csv', api_version)),
                     col_types = cols('iucn_sid' = 'i', 'code' = 'c'))

sens_all_df <- bind_rows(sens_gen, sens_fis, sens_cc)

sens_all_file <- here('_output', sprintf('spp_sensitivity_%s.csv', api_version))
write_csv(sens_all_df, sens_all_file)

```

## Species impacted by each stressor

Plotting the number of species impacted by each stressor.  This plot includes species that:

* have an IUCN range map
* are in a comprehensively assessed taxon (and birds are seabirds)
* are threatened or near threatened (i.e. not LC or EX)
* are sensitive to at least one stressor in our study

```{r}

sens_all_df <- read_csv(sens_all_file, col_types = cols('iucn_sid' = 'i'))

spp_incl <- get_incl_spp() %>%
  filter(!is.na(stressor))

plot_df <- sens_all_df %>%
  filter(sens) %>%
  select(-code, -sens) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(iucn_sid %in% spp_incl$iucn_sid) %>%
  group_by(stressor) %>%
  summarize(n_spp = n()) %>%
  arrange(n_spp) %>%
  mutate(stressor = fct_inorder(stressor))

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = stressor, y = n_spp)) +
  ggtheme_plot() +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = 'Stressor',
       y = 'Number of impacted species')
```
