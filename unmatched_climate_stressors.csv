2055,threats,"Development of large and small scale commercial fisheries have a negligible effect on South American Fur Seals in the Atlantic due to the minimal overlap between Fur Seal prey items and target commercial species (Crespo pers. comm.). In contrast, industrial fishing along the coast of Peru may threaten the pelagic resources on which Fur Seals depend. Those fisheries started in the 1950s and 1960s, and contributed to several declines in biomass of Anchoveta which is a major prey of Fur Seals (Pauly and Palomares 1989, Pauly and Tsukayama 1987).  Mortality due to bycatch and interactions is known to occur occasionally in artisanal and other fisheries (Maijluf  et al.  2002, Franco-Trecu  et al.  2009, De Maria 2012, Sepúlveda pers. comm., Cárdenas-Alayza unpublished data). Incidental captures of Fur Seals in shark nets have been reported in Uruguay (Scialabba 1989, Franco-Trecu  et al.  2009).   During the 1970s and part of the 1980s, South American Fur Seals (and other wildlife) were hunted illegally in southern Chile and Argentina to bait traps set for Southern King Crab. Bait used between 1976 and 1980 was estimated as 200–400 tons per year (Cárdenas  et al.  1987). Because this fishery is decreasing due to overexploitation, hunting pressure on the Fur Seal is being reduced. In Peru, Arias-Schreiber (1993) reported that it is common for some fishermen to kill and use pinnipeds as bait to catch saltwater Snails. However, the incidence of illegal Fur Seal catches and their impact on populations are not known.   The limited number of large, dense breeding aggregations could make this species particularly sensitive to the effects of oil spills and disease epidemics. Like other Fur Seals, South American Fur Seals are vulnerable to oil spills because of their dependence on their thick pelage for thermoregulation. In February 1997, 5,000 metric tons of crude oil were spilled from the vessel San Jorge onto on the coast of Isla de Lobos in southern Uruguay. Nearly 5,000 South American Fur Seal pups (2-3 months old) were heavily oiled and/or died (Mearns  et al.  1999).  With the breeding population located at a limited number of rookeries, human activities could have populations consequences if disturbance occurs (Cárdenas-Alayza 2012).",11.1,Arctocephalus australis,mammals
2467,threats," Extensive commercial hunting, beginning in the 1500s, depleted Bowhead Whales throughout their range. Commercial whaling for the species has been prohibited under international conventions since the 1930s. The limited subsistence whaling by indigenous communities  mentioned above has not impeded the recovery of the affected populations.  Accidental human-caused deaths are relatively few. During 2010-15, two dead-stranded and one live Bowhead were observed to be entangled with fishing gear but it was unclear whether the entanglement was the cause of death. Of the Bowhead Whales taken in Alaskan hunts during 1990-2012, 12% showed scars or wounds from fishing gear and 2% showed scars or wounds from ship strikes (George  et al.  2017a).    There has been concern since the 1970s that disturbance from oil and gas exploration and extraction activities in the Arctic region would affect Bowhead Whales. Effects on diving behavior (Robertson  et al.  2013) and calling rates (Blackwell  et al.  2015) in the vicinity of seismic surveys have been observed, but to date there has been no discernible population-level impact. Examination of whales taken in subsistence hunts off Alaska since 1980 found relatively low levels of morbidity, which would be consistent with an increasing population and good individual animal health (George  et al . 2017b).    During this century, a profound reduction in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic has occurred and this reduction is predicted to continue, possibly leading eventually to the complete disappearance of sea ice in summer as mean Arctic temperatures rise faster than the global average (Frey  et al . 2015). The short-term effects of reduced ice cover on Bowhead Whales in the western Arctic appear to be positive, due to increased feeding opportunities (George  et al . 2015, Moore 2016). However, the long-term effects are less clear. The emergence of Bowheads as a separate, ice-adapted species may have coincided with the appearance of sea ice in the late Pliocene, and Bowheads could lose out to non-ice-adapted species in the long term, but no projections of the time scale of such an eventuality are available (Harington 2008, IWC 2016).&#160;     There is also concern that, as the sea ice diminishes, the opening up of the Arctic to increased vessel traffic, fishing activities, and extractive industries will increase human-caused impacts on Bowhead Whales (Reeves  et al . 2012, 2014).&#160;  ",11.1,Balaena mysticetus,mammals
2477,threats," The main threat to Blue Whales in the past was direct exploitation, which only became possible on a regular basis in the modern era using deck-mounted harpoon cannons. Modern Blue Whale hunting started in the North Atlantic in 1868 and spread to other regions after the northeastern Atlantic population had been severely reduced, and whaling was temporarily banned in Norway from 1905 and in Iceland from 1915 (Tønnessen and Johnsen 1982). The Antarctic and North Atlantic populations were each probably depleted to the low hundreds by the time whaling ceased in the 1960-1970s, but have increased since. Blue Whales have been legally protected worldwide since 1966, although they continued to be caught illegally by former USSR fleets until 1972. The last recorded deliberate catches were off Spain in 1978 (Allison 2017).  Blue Whales in a calving ground off southern Sri Lanka appears to be especially subject to ship strikes, as indicated by both direct observations of strikes and strandings that exhibit blunt trauma (Ilangakoon 2012, de Vos  et al . 2016) and observations of living animals that appear to have injuries that prevent normal swimming (IWC 2018b). The large volume of ship traffic around the southern coast of Sri Lanka makes it one of the busiest ocean-going shipping lanes in the world, but Priyadasharnha  et al.  (2016)&#160;showed that the expected frequency of ship strikes on Blue Whales would be greatly reduced by moving the lanes slightly further offshore.  Nine deaths of Blue Whales plus some serious injuries were attributed to ship strikes on the west coast of North America during 2007-13 (Carretta  et al . 2017). Of 21 carcasses of Blue Whales found off California during 1988-2007, eight were found to have been killed by ship strike (Berman-Kowalewski  et al.  2010).&#160;This suggests that ship strikes represent a substantial addition to natural mortality (Rockwood  et al.  2017).&#160;Monnahan  et al . (2015), on the other hand, argued that ship strikes have only a small effect on this population.&#160;As of 2018 this issue had not been resolved.  Of the Blue Whales in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence photo-identification catalogue, 16% appear to have scars or wounds resulting from ship strikes (Sears and Calambokidis 2002).  McKenna  et al.  (2015) concluded from tracking data that Blue Whales do not demonstrate effective avoidance behaviour when ships are near.&#160;However, Priyardashana  et al.  (2016) showed, based on densities of whales and shipping, that the expected frequency of ship strikes off southern Sri Lanka would be an order of magnitude higher than current estimates if the Blue Whales took no evasive action.  Incidental catches of Blue Whales in fisheries appear to be rare. The only reported cases this century were one in the northeastern Pacific in 2015 and one in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in 2002. Blue whales in cold waters often have marks or scars caused by contact with ice, which can make it harder to identify scars caused by contact with fishing gear.  The main food of Antarctic Blue Whales,  Euphausia superba  and  E. crystallorophias  ,  are predicted to decline during the 21 st  century due both to reduced ocean productivity associated with warming (Piñones and Fedorov 2016) and to increasing ocean acidity that limits their shell-building (Kawaguchi  et al.  2013).&#160; Comparable changes are likely in other oceans. ",11.1,Balaenoptera musculus,mammals
6204,threats,"By-catch of Hooded Seals in coastal net fisheries has been reported from the USA, from trawl fisheries off Norway and Newfoundland, and from salmon drift nets used off Greenland (Woodley and Lavigne 1991, Reeves    et al.    1992, Waring    et al.    2005). Competition for food with commercial fisheries and other predators has been suggested as a factor that may limit population growth or lead to declines of Hooded Seals (Reijnders    et al.    1993). This factor may be playing a role in the continuing decline of Hooded Seals in the Northeast Atlantic given that abundance of Redfish, which are favoured prey of Hooded Seals, has declined in the late 1990s in both the Barents and Norwegian Seas due to excessive fishing pressure. No targeted catch is allowed for some Redfish species in this region and juvenile fish are being protected to attempt to promote recovery (ICES 2013b).  Impacts of oil spills on Hooded Seals have not been reported; however as an ice breeding species, they might be at risk of mortality from spills during the pupping season when newborn and newly weaned pups could be fouled (St. Aubin 1990). Hooded Seals have been exposed to  Morbillivirus  (Duignan    et al.    1997), but are not known to have suffered fatalities during the mass die-offs of Harbour Seals in European waters from phocine distemper virus in 1998 and 2002. Subsequent testing revealed antibodies to the virus in 18-24% percent of the Hooded Seals sampled indicating exposure to the virus (Harkonen    et al.    2006). Hooded Seals in the northeast Atlantic have high organohalogen contaminant burdens that are thought to be impacting thyroid homeostasis (Villanger    et al.    2013).  The Hooded Seal is a pack ice species, and is dependent on ice as a substrate for pupping, moulting, and resting and as such is vulnerable to reduction in extent or timing of pack ice formation and retreat (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Johnston    et al.    2005, Learmonth    et al.    2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre    et al.    2008). The very short, intense breeding season of Hooded Seals that is timed right at the end of the sea ice season, has likely put them at heightened risk of impacts arising from changes in the duration of the sea ice season (Kovacs    et al.    2011b, 2012; Stenson and Hammill 2014). The Barents Sea region’s sea ice cover is declining at twice the rate of other arctic areas with a shortening of &gt;20 weeks having taken place in the last few decades (Laidre    et al.    2015), so it is not surprising that the West Ice stock is the first to be heavily impacted.  The productivity of the ice-edge ecosystem is also dependent on the dynamics and seasonality of arctic ice, and alterations to the cycle of formation and retreat of the ice could be having negative effects on important Hooded Seal prey. For example, Polar cod abundance has declined markedly in the last decade in the Barents Region within a broad, rapid “borealization” of the fish community in this sector of the Arctic (Fossheim    et al.    2015). Decreases in sea ice cover could also lead to more shipping and development of extraction based industries in the Arctic (gas, oil, mining, etc.) which in turn could negatively affect Hooded Seals through increased exposure to contaminants and pollution, increased disturbance, and increased risk of shipping accidents and spills (Pagnan 2000).  Predation by Polar Bears is thought to be an increasing issue of concern with respect to the West Ice stock’s conservation status. Polar Bear diets have shown an increase in Hooded Seal consumption by 9.5% per decade since the mid-1980s in East Greenland along with a concomitant decrease in the consumption of Ringed Seals (McKinney    et al.    2013). These changes are likely primarily due to changes in sea ice distribution and extent (but could also reflect a declining Ringed Seal population).",11.1,Cystophora cristata,mammals
8012,threats,"Global climate warming is currently causing major reductions in the extent and duration of sea ice cover in the Arctic, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals. Pinnipeds such as the Bearded Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Laidre   et al.   2008, 2015; Cameron   et al.   2010; Kovacs 2011, 2012). Atlantic Bearded Seals are able to use glacier ice pieces that have calved into the sea as haul-out platforms, so tidal glacier fronts are very important to them in some areas (Lydersen   et al.   2014). Such areas may represent important breeding refugia in the future as sea ice continues to decline.  Increasing development and industrialization of the Arctic may threaten Bearded Seals in several ways. Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect them through direct contact with oil, but likely more importantly cause damage to foraging areas and stocks of benthic invertebrate prey. An increase in human-caused noise in the arctic environment could also negatively impact Bearded Seals, which communicate over distances of many kilometers during the breeding season. Increased shipping will pose a greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals (Pagnan 2000).",11.1,Erignathus barbatus ssp. barbatus,mammals
8013,threats,"Pacific Bearded Seals continue to be hunted by indigenous peoples of the Arctic with no evidence of an impact on their population. Reports from Alaska Native subsistence hunters do not give any indication that their numbers have declined (Quakenbush  et al . 2011).  Global climate warming is currently causing major reductions in the extent and duration of sea ice cover in the Arctic, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals (Laidre  et al.  2015). Pinnipeds such as the Bearded Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting, resting and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Laidre  et al . 2008). Cameron  et al.  (2010) concluded that climate warming and sea ice loss constitute the highest threat to the persistence of Pacific Bearded Seals. Impacts are likely to be more severe in the Okhotsk Sea than elsewhere in the North Pacific region; this sea is likely to become completely ice-free during the pupping and moulting periods.&#160;Within the USA there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Cameron  et al.  2010).  Increasing development and industrialization of the Arctic may threaten Bearded Seals in several ways. Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect them through direct contact with oil and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, which are vulnerable to oil contamination. An increase in human-created noise in the Arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Bearded Seals that are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat they otherwise might use. Increased shipping will pose a greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals. Cameron  et al.  (2010) concluded that these factors could constitute low-moderate threats to Bearded Seals.  Quakenbush  et al . (2011) analysed life history data on Bearded Seals collected in the Bering Sea in the 1960s, 1970s and 2000s. While they found that parameters such as growth rates, body condition and pregnancy rate sometimes varied among time periods, there was no indication that the current population is showing signs of stress.",11.1,Erignathus barbatus ssp. nauticus,mammals
8239,threats," The greatest threat to Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lions has been intentional culling in Southeast Alaska and Canada in the 1950s and 1960s. Those practices were discontinued in the early 1970s and the population has been increasing ever since. Some are killed in net fisheries off the west coast of North America. An unknown number may be shot during commercial fishing operations although it is generally believed that this source of mortality has been reduced greatly since the establishment of federal laws prohibiting killing of Sea Lions in Canada and the USA (NMFS 2013). The 2008 Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan found that there were no apparent threats limiting the recovery of the Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion population (NMFS 2008), and the increasing population trend confirms that conclusion.    The reasons for the large declines in Western Steller Sea Lion are unclear, but they have been the subject of intensive and ongoing investigations. Deliberate killing by fishermen, disease, incidental take by fisheries, and reduced food supply have been suggested as factors that may have contributed to the decline (Lowry  et al . 1989, Loughlin and York 2000). In the 2008 Recovery Plan, the Steller Sea Lion Recovery Team identified and ranked threats to recovery using a weight of evidence approach to assess their relative impact (NMFS 2008). They recognized three threats as “potentially high”: environmental variability, competition with commercial fisheries, and Killer Whale predation. The fact that this subspecies has been increasing since 2000 indicates that at least some of the threats previously affecting the population have been reduced. ",11.1,Eumetopias jubatus,mammals
9660,threats,"Grey Seals have been important in subsistence harvests in coastal areas within their range throughout history. They have been hunted in the Baltic Sea for more than 10,000 years (Härkönen   et al.   2005). Commercial harvesting has been ongoing in many areas for hundreds of years, and at times Grey Seals have been important to local economies (Mansfield 1988). Over-harvesting in the Baltic in the early 20th century led to a large decline; this population once numbered somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000, but was reduced to about 20,000 in the 1940s. A further decline to 1,500-2,000 seals was caused by high loads of PCB (Harding and Härkönen 1999).  Government culls, bounties and licensed kills for protection of fishing gear have been put into effect in many countries and continue to be used to control Grey Seal numbers and reduce their impact on commercially important coastal fisheries (i.e., salmonid fisheries). Grey Seals feed on a number of commercial species, and by damaging nets and traps they are in direct conflict with fisheries. They also are vectors for parasites that can have an impact on the economics of some fisheries (ICES 2005).  Entanglement in commercial fishing nets causes by-catch mortality in most parts of the Grey Seals’ range (Woodley and Lavigne 1991). By-catch levels are approximately 300 per year in Swedish fisheries in the Baltic (ICES 2005). A Norwegian study from 1975-1998 reported the death of 259 seals, primarily juveniles less than a year old, which represented 7% of the tagged animals in the region (Bjørge   et al.   2002). Among 528 deaths of tagged seals in the UK, 148 were attributable to fishing nets. However, this may overestimate the rate of entanglement-related mortality due to the high rate of tag returns from fisheries. Woodley and Lavigne (1991) suggested that 1-2% of animals less than a year old die in fishing gear. More recent photographic analysis of Grey Seals at haulout sites on Cape Cod, Massachusetts revealed 5-8% of Seals exhibited signs of entanglement (Sette   et al.   2009). Finally, in the US commercial fisheries there was an average annual mortality of 853 Grey Seals reported for the period 2006-2010 (Waring   et al.   2013). For the period 2008-2012, the total estimated human caused mortality (and serious injury to) Grey Seals was 4,533 per year of which about 1,000 were taken in US observed fisheries, about 400 in the Canadian hunt, 90 taken by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in scientific collections, and about 3,000 were killings of nuisance animals in Canada (DFO 2011).  Grey Seals are known carriers of phocine distemper virus (PDV), in all populations (Ross   et al.   1992, Duignan   et al.   1995, Härkönen   et al.   2006). However, they have suffered almost no mortality from the disease, in marked contrast to Harbour Seals. Härkönen   et al.   (2006) report Grey Seal mortality of approximately 230 (equal to 1% of the Harbour Seal mortality) in the 1988 epizootic in Europe and the death of 30 Grey Seal pups in the Baltic were attributed to PDV. Because Grey Seals haulout with Harbour Seals in the Wadden Sea and are known to travel more widely than the more sedentary Harbour Seal, it is presumed that they had a role in the outbreak and spread of the 2002 epizootic of PDV in Harbour Seals (Härkönen   et al.   2006).  Grey Seals are exposed to agricultural pollutants through the food chain in their coastal ranges. PCBs and DDT contaminant loads are extremely high in Baltic Grey Seals, despite the fact that tissue burdens have declined since the 1970s. Analysis of samples collected from 1996 to 1998 indicated that Grey Seals still have a very heavy load of contaminants when compared to other Seals outside the Baltic (ICES 2005).  Health effects on Grey Seals have been suggested to be linked to their high exposures to PCBs and DDT. Baltic Grey Seals have a relatively high rate of colonic ulcers associated with hookworm infestations, which are sometimes fatal. This condition is not found elsewhere (ICES 2005). Uterine stenosis and a host of other pathologies in other organs have been attributed to long-term exposure to environmental toxics, particularly in older Baltic Grey Seals. These are specifically linked to reproductive and population declines for this subspecies and are conditions not seen in other populations (Bergman   et al.   2001). However, no negative effects have been attributed to heavy metal contaminants in Baltic Grey Seals (Bergman   et al.   2001, ICES 2005).  Grey Seals live close to human population centres and shipping lanes and spend much of their time in the vicinity of favourite haulout locations. Spilled oil from vessel accidents and other sources have fouled Grey Seal sites since at least the 1940s (St. Aubin 1990). Despite numerous records of oiled animals and occasional reports of dead animals coated in oil, or animals having ingested oil, it has not been determined whether those mortalities are attributable to contact with oil (St. Aubin 1990).",11.1,Halichoerus grypus,mammals
13653,threats,"The Mediterranean Monk Seal is one of the most endangered pinniped species, and one of the most endangered Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) mammals on Earth (Isaac  et al . 2007,  EDGE  web site).  Mediterranean Monk Seals have a long history of interaction with humans that includes exploitation for subsistence needs, commercial harvest, and persecution as a competitor for fisheries resources or because it produced actual and perceived damage to fishing gear (Johnson and Lavigne 1999b, Stringer  et al . 2008). Once abundant, Monk Seals were written about and illustrated in the literature and depictions of classical antiquity (Johnson 2004). Along the coast of northwest Africa, they became the target of a commercial harvest for skins and oil by the Portuguese as early as the 15th century (Isräels 1992).  Reasons for population decline declines in the 20th century include: increased human pressure displacing seals from their habitat; destruction/alteration of suitable habitat; continued mortality due to deliberate aggression by fishermen to eliminate a competitor, even in countries and areas where the species is legally protected; fisheries by-catch; and a mass die-off at the Cabo Blanco Monk Seal colony.  Habitat deterioration, destruction, and fragmentation have played a significant role in the plight of the Mediterranean Monk Seal. Once an open beach dweller, the species has been persecuted by humans for centuries and forced to occupy increasingly marginal habitat. The gradual process from occupying open beaches to being displaced and forced into increasingly marginal habitat (i.e., smaller and more unsuitable marine caves) has been thoroughly documented (Johnson and Lavigne 1999a). This threat is still in place today, particularly in the eastern Mediterranean (MOm 2007, Notarbartolo di Sciara  et al . 2009, Kiraç  et al . 2013). An alarming decline in pupping success has been recorded in the most important pupping location of the species in southern Turkey (where up to seven pup births have been recorded) due to increased human activity (i.e., industrial development, including the construction of a thermal and nuclear power plant and a marine terminal). Critical Monk Seal habitat has been affected by increased tourism activities throughout Turkey, even in protected areas such as the Olympos Beydagları National Park, and the Kas, Kekova Specially Protected Area. Tourists and scuba divers in these areas appear to frequently visit Monk Seal shelters. Although some resting activity of Mediterranean Monk Seals continues, no pupping activity has been recorded in these caves (Gücü  et al . 2009). With human populations and coastal activities increasing around the Mediterranean, so do potential threats to the species habitat.  Interactions with fisheries are of great conservation concern, throughout the species range (Güçlüsoy and Savas 2003, Güçlüsoy 2008, Karamanlidis  et al . 2008, Hale  et al . 2011, González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2013). Deliberate killing of Monk Seals mainly by fishermen was responsible for one-third of all mortalities of 79 stranded animals in Greece (1991-1995) and is considered the single most important source of mortality for this species in the eastern Mediterranean (Androukaki  et al . 1999). Deliberate killing, hunting, and capturing live animals for exhibition purposes were the main cause for the population reduction of the species in Turkey until 1980 (Kiraç  et al . 2013).  Mediterranean Monk Seals have been entangled in a wide variety of fishing gear including set-nets, trawl nets, and long-lines (Johnson and Karamanlidis 2000) and entanglement remains a major source of mortality in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, especially for sub-adult animals (Karamanlidis  et al . 2008, Kiraç  et al . 2013). Adverse fishing interactions are also considered as one of the probable causes for the lack of recovery of the Cabo Blanco population after commercial sealing ended in the region. Currently, illegal industrial and artisanal fishing is one of the main threats to the survival of the colony, mainly for sub-adult seals (González and Fernandez de Larrinoa 2013). In comparison, the effect of negative seal-fisheries interactions in the archipelago of Madeira is considered to be lower. Traps, purse seines, and illegally used gill nets are the main fishing gear posing a threat to the species in the region (Hale  et al . 2011). However, concurrent with the recent expansion of the species’ range to the island of Madeira, signs of animosity towards the species by fishermen have been recorded, that potentially could pose a future threat (R. Pires pers. comm).  A  Morbillivirus  was isolated from Mediterranean Monk Seals after the mass mortality at Cabo Blanco in 1997. The virus most closely resembled a Dolphin  Morbillivirus  that was previously implicated in the 1991 mass mortality of Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea (Osterhaus  et al . 1992, van de Bildt  et al . 1999). However, although this virus was already circulating in Monk Seals prior to the mass mortality, there is some doubt as to whether it was responsible for the deaths that occurred. Indeed, the active virus was found in pups that went into a rehabilitation center because their mothers had died, and none of them showed clinical signs and all survived the event without specific treatment. Dinoflagellate-produced saxitoxins were found in tissues from animals that died during the die-off and the suddenness of death of the animals and the general clinical symptoms suggest that the cause of death was from the toxins rather than a  Morbillivirus  epidemic (Hernandez  et al . 1998). Toxic algal blooms (red tides) are favored by oceanographic conditions near Cabo Blanco and were reported from nearby Morocco during a 25-year period leading up to the mass mortality. Toxic algal blooms are unpredictable and following the catastrophic loss of Monk Seals in 1997 must be considered a serious threat to the species in the region (Reyero  et al . 2000, UNEP 2005).  Potentially, limited availability of food sources, genetic inbreeding, and pollution could constitute a threat to the survival of the species. Currently, not enough information is available to fully evaluate the magnitude of these threats, however there is no indication that they are significantly affecting the population at present.  In southern Turkey an important monk seal colony almost disappeared in the 1990s, when industrial-scale fishing in the area reduced the available fish sources and negative interactions of artisanal fishermen with monk seals (i.e., deliberate killings) increased. However, a series of regulations enforced to protect fish sources alleviated the problems and helped the local monk seal population to resume pupping in the area (Gücü  et al . 2004).  Genetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA (Pastor  et al . 2004, Pastor  et al . 2007, Karamanlidis  et al . 2014a) have shown that, as a consequence of severe population bottlenecks and population/habitat fragmentation, all sub-populations have suffered a dramatic decrease in genetic variability over the last few centuries. The genetic diversity of Mediterranean Monk Seals is among the lowest found in pinnipeds; it is comparable to Hawaiian Monk Seals and Northern Elephant Seals. The potential consequences of the loss of genetic variability and genetic inbreeding are still hard to evaluate for the Mediterranean Monk Seal, however potential consequences of genetic inbreeding include congenital defects leading to stillborn pups, something that has been recorded in several small Monk Seal populations (Bareham and Furreddu 1975, Pastor  et al . 2004, MOm, unpublished data). Additionally, low fitness and increased susceptibility to disease may be an effect of genetic erosion that can compromise a population and lead to extinction.  Contaminant burdens have always been suspected to be a threat to the Mediterranean Monk Seal and thus monitoring pollutants has been considered a high priority (Boulva 1979, Reijnders  et al . 1993). However, information is only available on organochlorine pollutants, which were analysed in the blubber of individuals collected during the 1990s from the Cabo Blanco and the Greek subpopulations. Residue levels were found to be very low in the former subpopulation and moderate to high in the latter (Yediler  et al . 1993; Borrell  et al . 1997, 2007); currently, efforts are underway to more fully evaluate the effects of pollution on the Mediterranean Monk Seal through the analysis of more recent samples from the eastern Mediterranean (Marsili  et al . 2014, Zaccaroni  et al . 2014).  Mediterranean Monk Seals are at an unknown, but suspected high, level of risk from oil tanker and other ship accidents, spills, and groundings. This results from increased tanker traffic in the area, and a greater chance for accidents, disturbance, and collisions near important habitat. Four accidents or spills have occurred near Monk Seal habitat in the recent past, including a supertanker that spilled oil off Morocco in 1989 (Isräels 1992), an oil spill in the Madeira Islands in 1990 (UNEP 2005), and the grounding of a bulk carrier near Cabo Blanco in 2003 (UNEP 2005). None of these spills or accidents had any known impacts on Monk Seals, but they highlight the threat of significant impacts from a major maritime accident near an important Monk Seal site (UNEP 2005). In contrast, a ship accident that occurred at Çavuş Island near Bodrum in southwest Turkey in 1996 directly affected Monk Seals and their habitat (Kiraç 1998). A clean-up operation lasting until 1997 effectively restored the habitat to its original quality. In response to this accident regulatory measures have been taken in Turkey to reduce the threat from oil spills (Kiraç and Guclusoy 2007).  More recently, the arrival of Lessepsian fishes in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, such as the toxic Pufferfish ( Lagocephalus sceleratus ), could have a negative impact on Monk Seals in the region. The Pufferfish has been implicated in the death of a Monk Seal at Cyprus (A. Gücü pers. comm). Additional risks to Mediterranean Monk Seals come from political instability in some parts of their range, the challenge of implementing effective conservation for a species in a complex multi-national environment, weak enforcement of agreements and international laws, collapse of occupied pupping caves, and reduction of the carrying capacity of the environment as a consequence of fishing overexploitation (Aguilar 1999).",11.1,Monachus monachus,mammals
13654,threats,"Recovery of Hawaiian Monk Seals has been affected to an unknown degree by disturbance from military activities in the NWHI including the alteration, development, and occupation of bases on several key islands that started before World War II (Ragen and Lavigne 1999). However, the military no longer has bases in the area and the vast majority of Monk Seals live where they are isolated from most direct human contact. The only permanent structures remaining in the NWHI are US Fish and Wildlife Service facilities at Tern Island and Midway Atoll, and remnants of former Coast Guard facilities at Kure Atoll. Degradation of these structures, particularly at Tern Island, poses a significant entrapment hazard for Monk Seals. There are also concerns about legacy chemicals and contaminants that were left behind.  Current threats to Monk Seals are thoroughly reviewed and analysed in National Marine Fisheries Service (2007). The most crucial threats in the NWHI at this time are: 1) food limitation that could be due to changes in oceanographic conditions, legacy impacts of fisheries, or competition with other predators; 2) entanglement in marine debris, largely fragments of net and line discarded by North Pacific fisheries; 3) predation by sharks, especially on pre-weaned and recently weaned pups; and 4) intraspecific aggression by sub-dominant males. An emerging threat in this region may be the loss of terrestrial habitat due to sea level increases resulting from global warming (Baker et al. 2006). The situation in the MHI is different, with the main threats there being: 1) interactions with commercial and non-commercial fishing gear especially hookings and entanglements in gillnets; 2) possible transmission of diseases from feral animals, domestic pets, and livestock to seals; and 3) intentional killing and harassment.",11.1,Neomonachus schauinslandi,mammals
15106,threats,"Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay  et al.  1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards  et al.  2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller  et al.  2011, Udevitz  et al.  2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay  et al.  2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller  et al.  2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov  et al.  2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig  et al.  2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.  Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz  et al.  2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers  et al.  2006, Skoglund  et al.  2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.  Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs  et al.  2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre  et al.  2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre  et al.  2008, Kovacs  et al.  2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller  et al.  2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay  et al.  2011, Garlich-Miller  et al.  2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova  et al.  2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.",11.1,Odobenus rosmarus,mammals

22104,threats," T. senegalensis  population decline has been largely attributed to hunting and incidental capture in fishing nets (Cadenat 1957, Blancou 1960, Dodman  et al . 2008). Although hunting is now illegal in every country in which the African Manatee occurs, laws are often not enforced and hunting and incidental captures are still not being accurately documented in most countries. Manatees are exploited for their meat nearly everywhere they are found, and in many countries the rest of the carcass is discarded. However, in certain countries such as Nigeria, Togo, and Côte d’Ivoire they are also hunted for their skin, bones, and oil for traditional medicines and rituals. They are hunted by various methods including nets, weirs, large box traps, drop traps using harpoons and snag lines, and hand-thrown harpoons (Kombo and Toko 1991, Powell 1996, Reeves  et al . 1988, Roth and Waitkuwait 1986, Akoi 1992, Collins  et al . 2011). The African Manatee is at the greatest risk of extinction due to the high levels of human poverty within its range of distribution (Marsh  et al . 2012).  In Côte d’Ivoire, Powell (1996) sighted Manatees on a daily basis, but found numerous large box traps situated around the rivers and lagoons from the Ghana border to Fresco. The 4 x 1 m traps are constructed of wooden poles stuck in the bottom and a door weighted with a large rock. Powell (1996) built two of these box traps for catching Manatees to radio tag; he caught five Manatees in two traps over four days. These traps are also used in Nigeria and Ghana (B. Dunsin unpublished data, M. Yelibora pers. comm.). Manatees are also caught in special nets with large mesh used specifically for Manatees. In Guinea-Bissau, Silva and Araújo (2001) reported 209 deaths from 1990–1998; of these, 72% died in fishing gear, 13% were hunted, 4% stranded at low tide and 11% the cause of death was undetermined.  Incidental bycatch in fishing gear is also a major threat in all African countries, and even when captured alive, most incidentally caught Manatees are not released, but are killed. Takoukam  et al . (2012) reported 13 Manatees incidentally caught and killed in fishing gear in nine months in coastal Cameroon. Cadenat (1957) recorded the deaths of five Manatees around Joal, Senegal in nets used for catching sharks. Manatees are frequently caught in monofilament nets that are now commonly used in all African countries. Manatees are occasionally killed in fishing trawls. In Côte d’Ivoire, stationary funnel nets are placed across the inlets of major rivers to catch shrimp swept past on tidal currents. These are strong nets that have a wide mouth that faces upstream and then narrows down to a small bag on the cod end. The tidal currents where they are usually set are often strong and several of these nets can block the entire channel. Between 1986 and 1988, three Manatees were killed in the vicinity of Grand Lahou by drowning in these nets, including one radio tagged Manatee (Powell 1996). Akoi (1992) described how Manatees in Côte d’Ivoire are sometimes caught in fishing weirs made of sticks. These weirs are common in Côte d’Ivoire and in many other areas in Africa.  In some locales there have also been reports of killings of large numbers of Manatees over a short period of time, such as 17 individuals killed in the Afram Arm of Lake Volta (Ofori-Danson and Agbogah 1995), 77 Manatees in the Cuanza River Angola in 1998 (Morais 2006), and 133 Manatees killed over three years in the Abanga River in Gabon (Louembet 2008). Johnson (1937) reported that as many as 12 Manatees a day were caught in a 100 mile (161 km) stretch of the Gambia River. Powell (1985) estimated around two Manatees a year were taken between 1978-1983 from this same area though this change cannot be attributed to less hunting pressure or reduced Manatee numbers (or both). If these large scale hunting operations are not curbed, it is entirely possible that the species will become extinct in certain places.  Due to poverty, remoteness and lack of enforcement, Manatees are taken for food and traditional medicinal products throughout their range (Powell 1996). Manatee meat is openly sold in local markets. In Cameroon, Manatee meat was sold along the roadside near Douala and could easily be spotted from a passing car. Manatee meat was seen on three out of five visits during a three month period (J. Powell pers. obs.). In the market in Lambarene, Gabon, Manatee meat was documented nine times between March 2012 and March 2013, as well as additional reports of Manatee being served in local restaurants during the same time period (Mvele and Arrowood 2013a). Manatee meat and oil is reported to move illegally in trade from Chad to Nigeria and Cameroon (Powell 1996, A. Wachoum pers. comm.). In Mali, Nigeria, and Chad, Manatee oil is more prized than the meat. The oil is used for its reputed medicinal properties to cure rheumatism and to condition the skin and hair (Kienta 1985, Reeves  et al . 1988). Oil from the head is used to treat ear infections. In Mali and along the Benue River, certain cuts of the meat are considered to have particular useful properties. For example, the parts of the penis are used to cure impotency in men, and the skin can be made into whips (Kienta 1985, Powell 1996). In Sierra Leone, villagers consume all parts of the Manatee carcass except for the heavy ribs (Reeves  et al . 1988). The meat is shared among villagers and any remains are sold by the trapper. The bones are used to make handles for walking sticks or spinning-tops used in a local game called cii. Little historical data exists for comparison to the present to know if decreases in catch rates are occurring over time.  Recent threats include loss of habitat due to damming of rivers, cutting of mangroves for firewood and destruction of wetlands for agricultural development. Coastal development all along the western side of the African continent is decreasing Manatee habitat.  In recent times hydroelectric and agricultural dams have also isolated Manatee populations in many major rivers, including in Lake Volta, Ghana (Akosombo Dam, constructed in 1965), the Niger River (Kainji Dam in Nigeria, constructed in 1968, and the Markala Dam in Mali, completed in 1945), and the Senegal River (Diama Dam, constructed in 1983 and the Kayes Dam in Mali). Since 2008, the Niger River Basin Authority has authorized the construction of three additional multi-purpose dams: at Fomi in Guinea, Taoussa in Mali, and Kandjadji in Niger (Diarra 2011). An additional dam has also been authorized at Kayes Mali on the Senegal River. All of these are likely to further restrict Manatee habitat in these countries and lead to genetic isolation of populations. At the Kanji dam on the Niger River, Nigeria and at the Akosombo dam on the Volta River, Ghana, Manatees have been known to be killed in the turbines and intake of the hydro-electric generator (Powell 1996). In Nigeria, for example, Isahaya (pers. comm.) reported seeing as many as six Manatee carcasses at one time below the Kainji dam. An agricultural dam constructed in 2008 at Navel, Senegal on a seasonal tributary of the Senegal River killed five Manatees within the first four years after it was built: three due to drowning against dam grates and two due to entrapment behind the dam. Seven other live Manatees were rescued from behind the same dam and released back into the Senegal River (Oceanium Dakar and L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).  In countries including Benin, Senegal, and Angola, Manatees can become trapped in small lakes as rivers and flooded areas dry up in the dry season (Dossou-Bodjrènou  et al . 2006, Morais 2006, Oceanium Dakar unpublished data). In some cases, such as during a severe drought in Lake Guiers in the 1970s, Manatees died due to stranding (Dupuy and Maigret 1978). In other cases, becoming trapped in these smaller bodies of water makes Manatees more vulnerable to hunting.  Coastal development near Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire resulted in loss of habitat and increased human disturbance contributing to the disappearance of Manatees in the area. Although still rare in Africa, increases in motorized boats and large vessel traffic in some of the rivers and lagoons may also pose a threat from collisions with watercraft, the highest known cause of death in Florida and Belizean Manatee populations. A pregnant female Manatee was struck and killed by a boat at a natural gas port at the mouth of the Congo River in Angola in 2007, and residents of nearby villages report a large decrease in Manatee sightings in the area since construction on the large facility began (L. Keith Diagne unpublished data).  National and international trade in live Manatees exists. In Nigeria and Mali Manatees have been captured for exhibit in local zoos. These Manatees usually die after a short time in captivity because their caretakers have not been properly trained and/or did not provide them enough food. Between 2000 – 2010, CITES records show that a total of 28 live Manatees were exported from four African countries (Cameroon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, and Côte d’Ivoire) to aquaria in Asia (Japan, Korea, China, and Taiwan). Wild caught Manatees from Guinea-Bissau are offered for sale on the internet (River Zoo Farms).

41672,threats,"Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology in Baltic Seals (Bergman and Olsson 1986), and high concentrations of mercury in Saimaa Seals is thought to have reduced pup production in the 1960s and 1970s (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kostamo  et al . 2002). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment, contaminant levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo  et al . 2002). The same is true with regards to POPs in Arctic populations (Wolkers  et al . 2008). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seals. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively affected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).  Manipulation of water levels, recreational snow machine operation, net-fishing, boating, tourism, and development of cottages on the shoreline have been noted as threats to the Ringed Seals in Lake Saimaa, and industrial pollution, net fishing and poaching, as well as disturbance of on-shore summer haulout groups have been highlighted as threats for the Ladoga Seals (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Agafonova  et al . 2007). Predation by Red Fox, Wolves, feral and domestic Dogs, and even birds of prey, are also risks for these lake Seals (e.g., Kunnasranta  et al . 2001). By-catch in fisheries and other negative impacts associated with fisheries conflicts seem at present to be the major threat to Saimaa and Ladoga Seals (Kokko  et al . 1998, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Verevkin 2002, Sipilä 2003, Agafonova  et al . 2007).  Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat required for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth  et al . 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre  et al . 2008). Early break-up of the ice results in poor condition of pups and higher mortality rates (Smith and Harwood 2001). Associated changes in precipitation and weather patterns could also negatively affect Ringed Seal populations if there is insufficient snow cover to protect pups in lairs in the spring (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Ferguson&#160; et al . 2005, Kelly&#160; et al . 2010, Hezel&#160; et al . 2012, Iacozza and Ferguson 2014). Pups born outside lairs have a very low chance of survival; the pups are so small that even large Gulls can be predators if they are exposed (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Declining trends in reproduction and survival of pups have already been noted in some regions that have been attributed to earlier break-up of the sea ice over recent decades and concomitant changes in the marine ecosystem (Ferguson  et al . 2005, Stirling 2005). Reductions in arctic sea ice could have quite dramatic effects via prey availability if Polar and Arctic Cod populations are negatively impacted.    Reductions in sea ice cover will likely lead to increased human activity in arctic regions in the form of shipping and resource extraction industries, with associated increased threat of marine accidents and pollution discharge (Pagnan 2000). An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Ringed Seals, to abandon areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997) although studies to date suggest relatively minor impacts of development (Davis&#160; et al .&#160;1991; Moulton&#160; et al . 2002, 2003, 2005; Blackwell&#160; et al .&#160;2004). However, over-flights by aircraft certainly cause disturbance to Ringed Seals if flights occur by helicopter at less than 1,500 m distance or by fixed-winged aircraft at closer than 500 m (Born&#160; et al .&#160;1999).",11.1,Pusa hispida,mammals

133706,threats," There is currently no evidence of human-related mortality or serious injury (i.e. injury likely to prove lethal), but in view of the remoteness of the subpopulation’s habitat, most deaths and injuries would likely pass unrecorded.    This subpopulation is potentially subject to entanglements in fishing gear, disturbance by vessels and other noise sources, ship strikes, and contaminants (including those related to offshore hydrocarbon development and transport). The continuing loss of sea ice in the Arctic is likely to result in a significant increase in trans-polar vessel traffic through Right Whale habitat in the Bering Sea and perhaps elsewhere (Reeves  et al . 2014).    As compared with the intensively studied North Atlantic Right Whale, the more offshore and remote distribution of the North Pacific Right Whale may be an advantage in terms of less frequent and intensive exposure to human activities, but the disadvantage is that any impacts of such activities that do occur are much less likely to be detected and their consequences would be harder to ascertain and evaluate. The density of fishing gear in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska is a fraction of that on the eastern coast of North America where North Atlantic Right Whales are frequently entangled, and analysis of photographs suggests a low frequency of entanglement scarring in eastern North Pacific animals relative to their North Atlantic congeners. Nonetheless, as noted above, the lack of sighting effort minimizes the probability that any injury or death of a Right Whale in the eastern North Pacific will be detected.

It is known that this species has an ultimate lower lethal temperature at 5 o C  (Strawn 1963). Therefore, individuals are subject to complete winter  die-offs in shallow impoundments throughout much of its range in the  southern U.S.; however, this species has survived in larger reservoirs  in spite of heavy winter mortality (Strawn 1963, Nobel 1981). At  temperatures below 12 o C, behavioral changes make them more susceptible to predation (Nobel 1981). More research is needed to accurately assess threats to this species.  In the San Francisco estuary (SFE), research was conducted to determine the potential causes of the systemic fish declines observed since 2000, addressing the most significant factors of changes in organic carbon accumulation, altered hydrology, changes to habitat volume&#160;and  Microcystis  seasonal variation.  Microcystis  blooms, seasonally occurring in freshwater reaches of the SFE from the end of June to the beginning of November,&#160;were first observed in the estuary only a year before the population decrease occurred. Subsequently, these blooms were linked to damage of wildlife and ecosystems within&#160;SFE (Lehman &#160;et al. &#160;2005, 2010). Furthermore, competition for food and direct consumption of copepod nauplii by the introduced clam  Corbicula amurensis  has resulted in changes in the abundance of zooplankton and mysid shrimp, which in turn have been linked to declines in planktivorous fishes (Sommer&#160; et al . 2007), including&#160; Dorosoma petenense .",11.3,Dorosoma petenense,clupeiformes

195409,threats," Overfishing is a major threat to this species, and its susceptibility to rapid population decline is increased due to heavy exploitation of spawning aggregations (Bullock  et al . 1992, Sadovy and Eklund 1999). Mangrove coverage, which is responsible for biomass production of this species, has been reduced by at least a third since the 1970s to 1990s, and much more of the habitat is unsuitable as juvenile habitat because of anthropogenic impacts (Sadovy and Eklund 1999, Valiela  et al . 2001, Koenig  et al . 2007, C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Multiple cohorts were affected by a cold temperature event in 2010, which caused a die-off of juveniles in the Everglades National Park, Florida (Hallac  et al . 2010). Juveniles have also been impacted by past severe red tide events on the West Florida Shelf (SEDAR47 2016). A study conducted in Florida reported that mean mercury concentrations in individuals of this species were within the range known to cause direct health effects in fish after long-term exposure, and concluded this could cause stress on their populations (Adams and Sonne 2013, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Another study conducted off Belize also found elevated levels of mercury (Evers  et al . 2009). Ongoing research on the impacts from high mercury concentrations indicate that older males in particular suffer liver damage and/or mortality, and that egg viability is reduced (C.

16674437,threats," In 1990–1992 a die-off devastated much of, if not the entire, Mediterranean population;  1,000 carcasses were examined in Spain, Italy and France alone, but the toll was undoubtedly much higher because these countries represent only a fraction of the Mediterranean coastline known to have been affected by the process (Bortolotto  et al.  1992, Aguilar and Raga 1993). Immediately after the event, the mean school size was found to be less than one third of original levels, which may be taken as an indication, but not as a proof, for a proportional reduction in overall population size (Forcada  et al.  1994). The primary cause of the die-off was a morbillivirus infection (Domingo  et al . 1990, Van Bressem  et al . 1993). The epidemic started in regions containing unusually large numbers of inbred dolphins that were possibly more susceptible to diseases (Valsecchi  et al.  2004). PCBs and other organochlorine pollutants with potential for causing immunosuppressive effects were suggested to have enhanced its lethality because the individuals that succumbed to the disease were those carrying the highest PCB tissue concentrations (Aguilar and Borrell 1994).     A second outbreak occurred in 2006–2007 affecting the coasts of Spain (Fernández  et al . 2008, Raga  et al . 2008), France and the Italian Ligurian Sea (Garibaldi  et al.  2008). The mortality associated with that event was moderate, with only about 200 carcasses reported, probably because older dolphins were still protected by the immunity developed during the 1990–1992 epidemic (Raga  et al.  2008). Moreover, differently to the previous outbreak, PCB levels in the individuals that succumbed to this event were not significantly different from those in the surviving population, which suggests that pollutants were of no relevance to the 2006–2007 event (Castrillon  et al . in press). Recurrent epidemics may have profound cumulative effects on the population dynamics of Mediterranean Striped Dolphins (Van Bressem  et al.  2009a).     Poxviruses with the potential to cause mortality of neonates and young calves are also circulating in this population (Van Bressem  et al . 2009b). Marine  brucellae  also infect Mediterranean Striped Dolphins (Van Bressem  et al . 2001). These bacteria may limit recruitment by compromising the normal functioning of male and female reproductive systems, inducing abortions and killing neonates and sexually mature individuals (Van Bressem  et al . 2009a). Finally, infection by the protozoan  Toxoplasma gondii  seems to be common in Mediterranean striped dolphins (Domingo  et al.  1992, Cabezon  et al.  2004) and has been suggested as another factor contributing to the death toll during morbillivirus epidemics.     Tissue levels of organochlorine compounds, some heavy metals, selenium and possibly other pollutants such as the brominated flame retardants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and perfluorinated compounds are high and often exceed threshold levels above which detrimental effects commonly appear in mammals (Aguilar 2000, Marsili  et al . 2001, Kannan  et al . 2002, Pettersson  et al . 2004). Blubber concentrations of DDT and PCB, the two main organochlorine pollutants, show a slowly declining trend in the last two decades (Aguilar and Borrell 2005) but are currently still high. Besides the alleged immunodepressive effect (see above), high PCB levels may have been implicated in the development of unusual luteinized cysts in the ovaries of four of 56 (7.1%) Mediterranean Striped Dolphins (Munson  et al.  1988), although other factors like the morbillivirus infection, stress and food depletion could have contributed to the abnormal surge or release of luteinizing hormone.     The Spanish driftnet fishery in the Alboran Sea reportedly killed 148–170 dolphins per season in the early 1990s (Silvani  et al . 1999); this fishery was halted in 1995 but the nets were transferred to Moroccan boats, which continue operating and are estimated to kill in the order of 1,500–2,000 Striped Dolphins per year (Tudela  et al . 2003). The Italian driftnet fishery ( spadare  fishery) has been claimed to kill 5,000–15,000 dolphins, mostly Striped Dolphins, per year (Di Natale 1992); although fishing effort is declining, current catch levels are thought to be still high. The French  thonaille  driftnet fishery has been estimated to kill 180–472 Striped Dolphins per season (Imbert  et al.  2001). Reports from other fisheries are sparse and bycatch data are not collected systematically, but what evidence there is suggests that incidental catches of Striped Dolphins are widespread and likely to represent a significant toll at least in pelagic purse-seines, drifting long-lines and gill nets (Di Natale and Notarbartolo di Sciara 1994). To this should be added a certain number of direct catches for human consumption or for use as bait, which still continue in several Mediterranean countries (SGFEN 2001).     The diet of Striped Dolphins includes commercial fish and cephalopod species (Pulcini  et al . 1992, Blanco  et al.  1995), so the widespread depletion of fishery resources in the Mediterranean has the potential to affect Striped Dolphin numbers. Global warming may have significant direct and indirect effects on cetacean populations in the Mediterranean (Gambaiani  et al . 2009). Climate variability and change affect biomass in a number of ways, including shifts in species distribution. Azzellino  et al . (2008b) showed a direct effect of sea surface temperature on striped dolphin distribution in the Ligurian Sea.",11.5,Stenella coeruleoalba Mediterranean subpopulation,mammals

An unknown number may be shot during commercial fishing operations although it is generally believed that this source of mortality has been reduced greatly since the establishment of federal laws prohibiting killing of Sea Lions in Canada and the USA (NMFS 2013).

In 2008, the US National Marine Fisheries Service released a Recovery Plan that identified and ranked threats to recovery using a weight of evidence approach to assess the relative impact (NMFS 2008).

Colonies have declined in line with observed increases in sea temperatures in Australia, in contrast to the fortunes of Bridled Tern, which have formed new colonies further south (Dunlop and Surman 2012). Variations in sea-surface temperature have been shown to negatively influence the species's foraging success at breeding colonies, hence lowering reproductive success (Erwin and Congdon 2007). Previously, persistent large scale egg-collecting in some areas has encouraged the species to move to suboptimal nesting sites, resulting in higher mortality and reduced reproductive success (van Halewyn and Norton 1984).

Invasive herbivores pose a threat through denudation of vegetation, with goats likely responsible for its extirpation on Malden Island (Gochfeld  et al . 2018). The denudation of Phillip Island by goats, before they died out in the early 1900s, and subsequent prevention of regrowth by rabbits, before their eradication in 1988, is likely to have contributed to their historical decline on this island (Priddel  et al . 2010). Increased SST has been demonstrated to reduce the provisioning rate at studied colonies in the Great Barrier Reef, and above a particular threshold of temperature reproductive success is nil (Chambers  et al . 2011).

Mass reproductive failure can also be caused by rat predation, as recorded in Punta San Juan (Merino 2017). Cats are also present across much of the Inca Tern’s range and have been found to affect other birds, such as the Peruvian Diving-petrel&#160; Pelecanoides garnotii , but there is no evidence of a direct impact on the Inca Tern.      The Inca Tern has been recorded attending a commercial trawler (Weichler  et al.  2004) and as bycatch in the artisanal Peruvian drift-net fishery, indicating a level of mortality occurring in this poorly monitored fishery, but only a single individual was killed in 914 sets (Mangel 2012), suggesting that the level of this bycatch is relatively low. Heavy harvesting of Peruvian anchovy, and the subsequent reduction of anchovy stocks, is considered to have been sufficient to impact breeding success, though there appears little direct evidence of the relative influence of harvest levels versus El&#160;Niño&#160;impacts. Guano harvesting may have an effect on population dynamics.

22694906,threats,"Climate related trophic shifts appear to have led to considerable declines in the numbers of Parakeet Auklet in Prince William Sound (Agler&#160; et al.&#160; 1999), although whether populations are affected more widely in Alaska is unknown. Modern populations are considered likely to be much lower than in the 19th Century as a result of harvesting and the introduction of invasive predators to many islands for fur production (Nettleship  et al.  2018). Additionally, large numbers were previously killed in the particularly destructive high seas salmon drift-net fishery (DeGange and Day 1991), which was closed in the 1990s following improved regulation. Numbers affected today are much smaller with an estimate across all gear types of 36 auklets caught annually between 2007 and 2015 (Eich  et al.  2016), and this level of mortality is unlikely to impact populations. Similarly, a total of only 31 oiled individuals were recovered after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, with the climate driven trophic shift more likely to have impacted the population (Agler  et al.  1999).  Subsistence hunting takes place at Pribilof, St. Lawrence and Little Diomede Island, but mortality levels have not been quantified. Out of 24 studied seabirds in the North Pacific, this species ranked highest in mean number of plastic particles per bird (Robards&#160; et al. &#160;1995). The impacts of plastic ingestion are unknown, but birds collected at Buldir showed no relationship between number of plastic pellets in crop and body condition, chicks were not fed plastic by parents (Bond  et al.  2010) and no population impact has been demonstrated.

22697782,threats,"The main threats are commercial fisheries, oceanographic changes, and oil spills (Mattern 2013). The Snares Islands are the site of a large squid fishery, which affects the Snares Penguin through resource competition (Ellis  et al.  1998; Crawford  et al.  2017) while bycatch in set net fisheries is also a known source of mortality (Crawford  et al.  2017). Both of these threats have the potential to drive significant declines, but do not seem to be doing so at present.  There are no introduced predators on the Snares Islands and consequently the possibility of the accidental introduction of mammals is a continual concern (Mattern 2013). The probability of colonisation is low due to the biosecurity measures in place and rats or mice, the most likely species to colonise appear to have minimal impact on other  Eudyptes  species. However, other members of the genus in the region have undergone considerable long-term declines ( E. sclateri ,  E. chrysocome ), perhaps due to oceanic warming and the associated change in distribution of prey species (Ellis&#160; et al. 1998, Morrison&#160; et al.&#160; 2015), hence continued monitoring of the population is essential.

",11.3,Eudyptes sclateri,birds
22697805,threats," Principle threats to Little Penguins are introduced predators, bycatch, habitat loss through coastal development, oil pollution, mortality through roadkill and human disturbance at breeding colonies (Chiaradia 2013, Dann 2013, Cannell  et al.  2016). Additionally, the impact of changing oceanic conditions appears to impact food availability and reproductive success (Voice  et al.  2006, Wu  et al.  2012). Introduced predators impact colonies throughout the range to varying extents, with significant mortality occurring particularly from domestic dogs  Canis familiaris , but impacts also noted from pigs  Sus domesticus , cats  Felis catus&#160; and Weka  Gallirallus australis . The species is assessed as being moderately at risk from bycatch in gillnets, although data is lacking (Crawford  et al.  2017). As such, recreational gillnets in some parts of the range appear to have the potential to cause considerable mortality (Crawford  et al.  2017). Some Tasmanian colonies have spatial closures (Lyle  et al.  2014), but many have no protection and large numbers of gillnets are registered on the island (Crawford  et al.  2017).      An additional challenge for this species is in the fast changing marine and terrestrial environment, particularly the rapidly warming sea of south Australia (Voice  et al.  2006, Wu  et al.  2012). In southwestern Australia, the warming sea has been associated with poorer breeding including lower fledging success, fewer chicks per pair and a lower mean mass of chicks at fledging (Cannell  et al.  2012). Penguins have been also shown to catch less prey in warmer conditions (Carroll  et al.  2016). Oceanographic change may lead to a mismatch between plankton and the small pelagic fish that are also penguin prey (Hinder  et al.  2013).    On land, increasing terrestrial temperatures in the spring and summer months can cause fatal hyperthermia in both chicks and adults (Cannell  et al.  2011,   2012,   2016). This is particularly relevant in those colonies where nesting occurs within the vegetation rather than in burrows, as a result of soft, sandy substrate.     Some of these pressures have been locally offset by a wide range of conservation efforts, such as the case of increasing population size at Phillip Island (Sutherland and Dann 2012), St Kilda (Preston  et al.  2010, Preston 2011), Manly (Carlile  et al.  2015), Oamaru (Agnew  et al.  2016). Sites without strong conservation measures have experienced severe decreases, and many known breeding colonies no longer exist (Dann 1994, Stevenson and Woehler 2007). ","11.1, 11.3",Eudyptula minor,birds
22697810,threats,"     Population declines have been attributed to food shortages resulting from shifts in the distributions of prey species, competition with commercial purse-seine fisheries and environmental fluctuations (e.g. Crawford  et al.  2011). A decrease in foraging effort at St Croix Island (Pichegru  et al.  2010) and an increase in chick survival and chick condition at Robben Island (Sherley  et al.  2015, Sherley 2016) following the establishment of 20 km no-take zones provides some support for this theory. In the early 2000s, there was an eastward shift in sardine and anchovy stocks, with the mature biomass of these species decreasing near the breeding islands north of Cape Town (Crawford  et al.  2011). The abundance of these prey species is known to influence breeding success (Crawford  et al.  2006, Sherley  et al.  2013b), adult survival (Sherley  et al.  2014a, Robinson  et al.  2015), and juvenile survival (Weller  et al.  2016), all of which may often be too low off South Africa’s west coast to maintain population equilibrium (Weller  et al.  2014, 2016). Western Cape populations declined by 69% between 2001-2009, considered at least partly due to this climate-induced shift in fish stocks. In Namibia, where sardine and anchovy are virtually absent from the foraging ranges of breeding penguins, breeding birds feed principally on the energy-poor Bearded Goby  Sufflogobius bibarbatus  (Ludynia  et al.  2010). Limited mortality in fishing nets may increase if gill-nets are set near colonies (Ellis  et al.  1998, Crawford  et al.  2017). Human disturbance and egg-collecting were important factors in the decline of the species in the early 20th century (Frost  et al.  1976b, Ellis  et al.  1998, Shannon and Crawford 1999). Egg collection is now illegal, but is still recorded in some areas of the African Penguin’s range. Guano collection was historically a major cause of disturbance at many colonies and the removal of guano deprived penguins of nest-burrowing sites, causing birds to nest on open ground where they are more vulnerable to heat stress resulting in the abandonment of nests, flooding of nests by rain, and increased predation (Frost  et al.  1976b, Shannon and Crawford 1999, Pichegru 2013, Kemper 2015). Both chronic oil pollution and individual large oil spill appear to have long-term significant impacts on colonies. Past mortality from oil spills has been serious (Wolfaardt  et al.  2009) and may increase if proposed development of harbours close to colonies proceeds. Most of the population is confined to areas that are near existing or planned major shipping ports (Nel and Whittington 2003, J. Kemper  pers. comm. ). There has been a dramatic increase in the number of birds oiled since 1990: two individual oil spills (in 1994 and 2000) killed 30,000 individuals, despite successful rehabilitation programmes (Nel and Whittington 2003, Wolfaardt  et al.  2008, 2009). Moreover, breeding success on Robben Island fell to 0.23 chicks per pair in 2000, compared with an average of 0.62 ±0.19 over the other 15 years from 1989 to 2004 (Crawford  et al.  2006). Rehabilitation does not necessarily prevent problems in the years after a spill. During 2001-2005, pairs involving at least one bird rehabilitated from the oil spill in 2000 achieved lower fledging success (43%) compared to unaffected pairs (61%) and those involving at least one bird affected by a previous oil spill (71%), mostly owing to higher mortality in older chicks (Barham  et al.  2007). This may indicate physiological or behavioural problems that reduce the parents' ability to meet the food requirements of older chicks, perhaps owing to the toxicity of the heavy oil in the 2000 spill; the effects of prolonged captivity; or the time between oiling and washing (Barham  et al.  2007). The Cape Fur Seal  Arctocephalus pusillus  competes with penguins for food, displaces them from breeding sites and imposes significant mortality at some colonies (Crawford  et al.  1989, Makhado  et al.  2013, Weller  et al.  2016, MFMR  unpubl. data ). Modelling of the interaction of multiple pressures on the colonies at Robben and Dyer Islands indicate that predation by Cape Fur Seals is a key driver in current population declines (Weller  et al.  2016). However, this was found to be in addition to immature emigration, suggesting there may be additional bottom-up pressures impacting the viability of colonies.            The potential effects of individual storms on breeding colonies at certain sites has been highlighted (de Villiers 2002) and, as such, the increased frequency and severity of storms may cause localised losses. Sharks take some birds at sea and Kelp Gulls  Larus dominicanus , dogs  Canis familiaris&#160; and feral cats  Felis catus  prey on eggs and chicks at colonies (Underhill &#160;et al.&#160; 2006, Pichegru 2013, Weller  et al.  2014, 2016). In some mainland colonies, predation by mongooses, leopards and caracals, or illegal egg collection may have notable impacts (e.g. Underhill  et al.  2006).     ",11.1,Spheniscus demersus,birds

The collapse in sardine populations around the Galápagos Islands caused the boobies to shift to feeding on lower quality flying fish, leading to a halving of annual breeding success and causing the population to start to decline (Tompkins  et al.  2017). Predictions of rapid further warming around the Galápagos Islands would result in sardines being permanently excluded from the masked booby's foraging range, preventing the growth rate from recovering (Tompkins  et al.  2017).",11.3,Sula granti,birds
45433088,threats,"     Traditional harvesting  – In Kenya, the indigenous Pokomo people have eaten crocodile meat and eggs, but the increasing Pokomo population is placing additional pressure on  Crocodylus niloticus   numbers (D. Haller pers. comm. 2016). Uncontrolled use of crocodiles for traditional medicine such as blood, fat, brains and other organs is posing&#160; pressures on some  C. niloticus  populations (Combrink  et al.   2011).   Human-crocodile conflict  –  Crocodylus niloticus   is a large predator and the recovery of  C. niloticus   numbers in close proximity to an increasing human population often results in fatal conflicts. 2015 statistics compiled within CrocBITE (2013, Sideleau 2016) report 58 fatal and 29 non-fatal  C. niloticus   attacks. However, reporting of attacks, both fatal and non-fatal, is poor across the range states of  C. niloticus,   so these numbers are conservative. It has been estimated that over 250 human fatalities occur each year in Kenya alone (D. Haller pers. comm. 2016). Retaliation killings of crocodiles are common across range states.   Land use  –  Crocodylus niloticus   attack cattle as they drink at the water’s edge. In retaliation, Kenyan pastoralists have started to kill crocodiles using pesticide-laced meat in order to preserve their cattle herd (D. Haller pers. comm. 2016). Furthermore, fishermen trap crocodiles with hooks, nets and laced bait and use the crocodile meat as baits for their fish traps, although considerable effort has been made by the Kenya Wildlife Service and the private sector (Nile Crocodiles Ltd) since 2014 to stop this practice (D. Haller pers. comm. 2016). Similar land use pressures are occurring in Botswana (Shacks 2018), Madagascar (CITES 2016), Namibia (Lyet  et al.   2016), South Africa (Combrink  et al.   2011, Calverley and Downs 2017) and Zimbabwe (Childes  et al.  2016) . Larger anthropogenic interference also alters population processes. For example, the Pongolapoort Dam in Ndumo Game Reserve, completed in 1972, allows artificial control of water flow rates and subsequent flooding. One consequence is that during flood events, the natural watercourse is diverted away from historical nesting grounds (Calverley and Downs 2017).    Food  – unregulated or illegal overfishing in many range states is depleting fish stocks, which could have detrimental effects on  C. niloticus   populations.          Pollution  – Ashton (2010) reported increased nutrient and sediment profiles of the water column of the Olifants River, South Africa due to upstream mining, industrial and agricultural activities, and urbanisation. These have caused isolated large-scale fish mortality incidents. Histopathological investigation of dead crocodiles were found to have fed on these dead fish and succumbed to pansteatitis. Additional mining leases have been granted in the upper Olifants River and unless environmental protection mechanisms are implemented, the aquatic health may continue to decline (Ashton 2010). Similar pollution concerns are being raised in the South East Lowveld region in Zimbabwe, where rivers flow through large sugar plantations and fish health is starting to decline due to contamination with agricultural chemicals and fertilisers (S. Childes pers. comm. 2017). Lead uptake by the ingestion of fishing sinkers has also been reported (Warner  et al.   2016).   Invasive weeds  – In 2001, Leslie and Spotila reported that the invasive Triffid/Siam Weed,  Chromolaena odorata  , is found in Lake St. Lucia within the iSimangaliso (previously Greater St. Lucia) Wetland Park in South Africa. The weed could be detrimental in a number of ways. First, Leslie and Spotila (2001) noted that many females were trying to dig holes to lay their eggs but could not dig through the fibrous root mats. Second, if the roots could be avoided,  Chromolaena odorata   shaded the nests reducing their average temperature by 5-6 o C cooler relative to sun-exposed nests. Like all crocodilians, sex ratios of  C. niloticus   are determined by incubation temperature (Hutton 1987) and nests shaded by  Chromolaena odorata   are below the pivotal (1:1 male:female) ratio leading to a female-biased sex ratio (Leslie and Spotila 2001). Furthermore, as in other crocodilian species, hatchlings resulting from less than ideal incubation conditions can have a higher frequency of abnormalities (Webb  et al  . 1983, Fergusson 1987), in addition to influences on post-hatching body size (Webb  et al  ., 1987; Allsteadt and Lang, 1995), residual yolk mass (Webb  et al  . 1987, Allsteadt and Lang 1995), growth (Hutton 1987, Webb and Cooper-Preston 1989) and thermoregulatory behaviour (Lang 1987). The worst case scenario is complete embryonic developmental failure (death) due to sub-optimal temperatures (Webb and Smith 1984). Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, the provincial conservation agency, have a programme to annually eradicate  C. odorata   from known  C. niloticus   nesting areas along the Mphathe Stream a few months prior to crocodile nesting. It was found that females do return to cleared sites for oviposition (X. Combrink, pers. comm. 2018).    Habitat destruction  – The habitat of Nile Crocodiles is being modified in numerous ways. For example, the Lake Flag Boshielo dam wall (South Africa) was raised by five meters in 2005 and the resultant rise in water level flooded the existing basking sites of the resident  C. niloticus   population; within four years the population had decreased from 135 individuals to 98, which was also reflected in the adult population (Ashton 2010). A similar situation was reported by Calverley and Downs (2017) in the Ndumo Game Reserve (South Africa) after the construction of Pongolapoort Dam, which artificially controls water flow rates and subsequent flooding that has diverted the natural watercourse away from historical nesting grounds. In contrast, the construction of the Aswan Dam, Egypt have led to population expansions of Nile crocodiles there (M. Ezat pers. comm. 2016). Another example of habitat destruction is in Kenya and Madagascar where people are moving towards the river to cut out small plots to live and grow crops, leading not only reduced crocodile (nesting) habitat but exacerbating human-crocodile conflicts (D. Haller pers. comm. 2016, CITES 2016). Other habitat loss includes siltation of rivers due to anthropogenic factors such as clearing, burning and subsequent erosion (Zisadze-Gandiwa  et al  . 2012, CITES 2016).

In the Eastern Tropical Pacific severe localized fish species declines have occurred after strong ENSO events that result in shallow waters that are too warm and nutrient poor for extended periods of time (Edgar  et al.  2009). The frequency and duration of ENSO events in this region of the Eastern Tropical Pacific appears to be increasing (Glynn and Ault 2000, Soto 2001, Chen  et al.  2004).

61963499,threats,"As the Pacific Walrus is being considered for listing under the US Endangered Species Act, considerable attention has been devoted to identifying and evaluating threats (Garlich-Miller  et al.  2011). The primary threats that have been identified are habitat changes caused by a warming climate and directed harvest.  Global warming and any associated reduction in the extent, timing and characteristics of seasonal sea ice cover could negatively affect Pacific Walruses. Declining sea ice reduces suitable haulout and breeding habitat and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Laidre  et al.  2008). The duration of the ice-covered season has already been substantially reduced within the Pacific Walrus range (Laidre  et al . 2015). Global climate models suggest moderate changes for winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller  et al.  2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable for Walruses because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events and predation (Jay  et al.  2011, Garlich-Miller  et al.  2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduced sea ice cover will&#160;also&#160;allow for a greater diversity and intensity of potentially disruptive human activities (e.g., shipping and coastal development) in Pacific Walrus habitat, bringing additional potential threats to the population. As an example, low-level aircraft over-flights and near shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on Walruses at land haul-out sites, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes (Fay and Kelly 1980). Mortality of calves on haul-outs caused by trampling could have a substantial effect on the future population size (Udevitz  et al.  2013).  Human harvests have had&#160;major impacts on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay 1982, Fay&#160; et al. &#160;1997).&#160;All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been covered by numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller&#160; et al. &#160;2011), allowing the population to recover. The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska to this day (Robards&#160; et al. &#160;2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller&#160; et al. &#160;2011, Udevitz&#160; et al. 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as warming and sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could become an important influence (Jay&#160; et al.  2011).  The Pacific Walrus faces additional threats, including environmental contaminants, oil and gas industry activities, fisheries and shipping. These are not considered to represent significant threats to the population at this time, but all of them have potential to impact Pacific Walrus in the future. Of greatest concern is a large oil spill associated with oil and gas development activities or shipping. While the probability of a large oil spill is low, a spill could have significant impacts if it contacted large aggregations of Walrus along the Arctic coast or offshore, or if oil impacted the benthic communities in which they feed (Garlich-Miller  et al.  2011).",11.1,Odobenus rosmarus ssp. divergens,mammals
62030608,threats," The species is at risk from reductions in food supplies due to changes in fishing practices. Reduction in discards has greatly reduced available food in parts of the species range that had seen rapid increases in the previous century. Further, trophic shifts have impacted fishing activity and catch size, which appears to be directly related to colony reproductive success: lower catches are resulting in lower breeding success and the decline of colonies in the UK (Foster  et al.  2017). The species is also vulnerable to collisions with wind turbines (Bradbury  et al.  2014) was the most frequently recorded casualty in a study of 4.7 km of the English coastline over 11 years (Newton and Little 2009). In the past, persecution has represented a significant source of mortality however, the EU directive (2009/147/EC) has made it an offence to kill birds or destroy eggs without license. This has likely resulted in a reduction in mortality due to persecution, however, there is still some level of culling, with 5,000 birds culled under license 2010-12 in the UK (Coulson 2015). The threat is unlikely to disappear, with recent paper calling for lethal controls for closely related  Larus &#160;spp. in Gulf of Maine (Scopel and Diamond 2017) however, this is thought to cause negligible declines. Botulism reports have been increasing in Britain in last 45 years and, despite the number of deaths not having been quantified, it is suggested to have been a factor in the population declines in Britain (Coulson 2015).
