2763,threats,"Baird’s beaked whales are one of the few species of ziphiids to be commercially hunted (Kasuya 2002; Kasuya and Ohsumi 1984). Small numbers have been hunted by the Soviets, Canadians and Americans, whereas hunts by Japan have been major. The Japanese fishery started in the early 1600s and underwent several expansions and declines. At its peak, after World War II, over 300 whales were killed annually. Now the industry operates with a quota of 8 for the Sea of Japan, 2 for the southern Okhotsk Sea and 52 for the Pacific coasts (Kasuya 2002).   Incidental catches have been recorded, but are generally not common. Some Baird's beaked whales have been caught in Japanese salmon driftnets (Reeves and Mitchell 1993).   This species, like other beaked whales, is likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by navy sonar and seismic exploration (Cox  et al . 2006)   Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, given its cool-temperate to sub-polar habitat, although the nature of likely impacts is unclear (Learmonth  et al . 2006).",5.4.2,Berardius bairdii,mammals
8239,threats," The greatest threat to Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lions has been intentional culling in Southeast Alaska and Canada in the 1950s and 1960s. Those practices were discontinued in the early 1970s and the population has been increasing ever since. Some are killed in net fisheries off the west coast of North America. An unknown number may be shot during commercial fishing operations although it is generally believed that this source of mortality has been reduced greatly since the establishment of federal laws prohibiting killing of Sea Lions in Canada and the USA (NMFS 2013). The 2008 Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan found that there were no apparent threats limiting the recovery of the Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion population (NMFS 2008), and the increasing population trend confirms that conclusion.    The reasons for the large declines in Western Steller Sea Lion are unclear, but they have been the subject of intensive and ongoing investigations. Deliberate killing by fishermen, disease, incidental take by fisheries, and reduced food supply have been suggested as factors that may have contributed to the decline (Lowry  et al . 1989, Loughlin and York 2000). In the 2008 Recovery Plan, the Steller Sea Lion Recovery Team identified and ranked threats to recovery using a weight of evidence approach to assess their relative impact (NMFS 2008). They recognized three threats as “potentially high”: environmental variability, competition with commercial fisheries, and Killer Whale predation. The fact that this subspecies has been increasing since 2000 indicates that at least some of the threats previously affecting the population have been reduced. ",5.4.4,Eumetopias jubatus,mammals
10340,threats,"There are currently no major threats from human activity within the species’ normal range.&#160;  Learmonth  et al . (2006) list the effects of global climate change on Leopard Seals as unknown. However, loss of sufficient areas of pack ice habitat suitable for pupping, resting and avoidance of predators, and availability of preferred prey such as Penguins, other Seals, Krill and fish that might all possibly decline, could effect Leopard Seals directly or indirectly to an unknown degree. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rises, on Antarctic ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as Seals are unknown.&#160;Siniff  et al . (2008) suggested that similar to Crabeater Seals, Leopard Seals would be less affected by changes in sea ice than Ross or Weddell Seals.   Two species of Antarctic ice seals, Leopard and Crabeater, have tested positive for antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV). The effects of an outbreak of this or other diseases on Leopard Seals either as a disease within this species, or repeatedly transmitted to it from an outbreak in a prey species such as the Crabeater Seal, are unknown. Leopard Seals are generally solitary except when females attend their pup or when pairs mate, so transmission of disease within the species would likely be slow or only seasonally significant. CDV is believed to have arrived in the Antarctic with sled dogs before the advent of vaccines. A mass mortality of Crabeater Seals occurred in 1955, with many animals displaying viral illness symptoms prior to death, but the exact cause of death is unknown (Bengtson and Boveng 1991).  Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessels passage, and close approaches by people in small boats and on land on Leopard Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is also a risk of injury to a small number of animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessels passing through ice fields.  There are no reports of significant fisheries interactions. Commercial harvest of Krill may pose direct or indirect threats to Leopard Seals, if conducted on a large scale.",5.4.4,Hydrurga leptonyx,mammals
12305,threats,"The Southern River Otter habitat is very sensitive to anthropogenic impacts (Medina-Vogel  et al . 2003,&#160;Sepúlveda  et al . 2009,&#160;Valenzuela  et al . 2013). In those subpopulations inhabiting freshwater environments the high demand for water by human activities such agriculture, human use, etc. is altering watercourses through canalization and drainage and loss of riparian vegetation. These activities are promoted to increase the amount of agricultural lands but are impacting those otter subpopulations distributed in lowlands, particularly in the Central Valley and the Coastal Range of Chile (Medina-Vogel&#160; et al .&#160;2003,&#160;Sepúlveda&#160; et al .&#160;2009). In the case of Andean lakes, where the species occurred historically, the high level of urbanization and tourism has been proposed as the main causes responsible for the local extinction of the species in those areas (Medina 1996). Other threats are poaching (Medina 1996,&#160;Espinosa 2012), predation by free-ranging domestic dogs (Espinosa 2012) and transmission of diseases such as Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) (Sepúlveda  et al . 2014). Free-ranging dogs are an important threat to carnivores because of predation and disease transmission (Vanak and Gompper 2009), and are present in rural and protected areas where the Southern River Otter occurs (Sepúlveda&#160; et al .&#160;2014). Implementing dog population control measures as well as vaccination programmes are an important measure to mitigate the impact of dogs on this species (Sepúlveda&#160; et al .&#160;2014). In several parts of the otter's distribution range, hydroelectric dams are installed or are planned to be built in the near future but no research on the potential impact of these on the otters has been conducted so far. The presence of wild exotic salmon and the salmon farming industry are suggested as a potential threat to otter prey leading to potential competition between otters and salmon (Medina 1996,&#160;Aued  et al . 2003,&#160;Cassini  et al . 2009) but no studies have confirmed this as yet. In relation to the invasive American Mink ( Neovison vison ), although several studies have investigated competition between these mustelids and river otters (Medina 1997,&#160;Aued  et al . 2003,&#160;Fasola  et al . 2009,&#160;Valenzuela  et al .&#160;2013), there is no clear evidence of a negative effect of the mink on the otter. Indeed, current studies in the marine part of the range suggest a negative effect of otters over minks by habitat (Valenzuela  et al . 2013) and temporal segregation (Medina‐Vogel  et al . 2013). The invasive mink is a potential vector of CDV to otters given their behavioural similarities and sharing of latrines (Sepúlveda  et al . 2014).",5.4.4,Lontra provocax,mammals
39324,threats,"This shark's flesh is of good quality and it is also taken in some areas for its hide and liver oil. Intensive commercial and sports fisheries in San Francisco Bay targeting it for its fine meat caused a marked local decline in numbers during the early 1980s. It is utilised in China for its skin and liver. Pollution may be a possible threat to inshore bays which are nurseries.  Although wide ranging in temperate waters and moderately common where not heavily exploited (e.g., southern Africa), this large shark has a limited inshore bathymetric range in heavily fished temperate waters and is often concentrated in shallow bays. This exposes it to intensive inshore bycatch and sometimes targeted commercial, sports and semi-commercial fisheries over most of its range, particularly off China, California, Argentina, Namibia and South Africa (Compagno in prep. a).

41008,threats,"  The main threats to  Hippocampus comes  are direct exploitation, habitat destruction and incidental catch. The species is exploited to supply the traditional medicine, curio and aquarium trades (Perry  et al.  2010, Lim  et al.  2011). the majority of which is sourced from incidental bycatch in commercial and artisanal fishers throughout its range in Malaysia and Thailand (Choo and Liew 2003, Perry  et al.  2010), Vietnam (Giles  et al.  2006) and the Philippines (Vincent  et al.  2007).      Pressures on  H. comes  in the central Philippines is particularly high with target capture, destructive fishing and macroalgal farming (Morgan and Vincent 2007). The reefs that comprise a major habitat for this species are threatened by land-based activities such as coastal development, siltation and pollution (Burke  et al.  2002). Destructive fisheries such as blast fisheries and cyanide fishing occur throughout the species’ range, causing coral and seagrass damage (Gomez 1997, Short  et al.  2011), These habitats are vital to the ecology of  H. comes  (Morgan and Vincent 2007) and the decline in suitable habitats throughout the species range raises the probability of decline in population in addition to other threats. Extremely low H. comes densities were reported in areas with poor benthic quality suggesting that activities which reduce the variety of benthic forms may negatively affect the species (Marcus  et al.  2007).

41671,threats,"As noted earlier, Harp Seals have been harvested for thousands of years but currently the population is large and the number of animals harvested is declining.  Reduced availability of potential prey, especially Polar Cod, Capelin and Herring, is a threat to Harp Seals. Several Harp Seal “invasions” took place in recent decades along the north coast of Norway. By-catch mortality in nets during those events was estimated to be as high as 100,000 animals in 1987 and 21,474 in 1988 (Haug  et al.  1991). The reason for these emigrations out of their normal range within the Barents and Greenland Seas seems to have been a collapse of Herring and Capelin stocks due to a combination of overfishing and shifting oceanographic conditions (low temperatures and salinity, and extensive ice cover; Haug  et al.  1991, Woodley and Lavigne 1991). More recently, declining Krill abundance has been correlated with declines in both pup production and body condition of Harp Seals in the Barents Sea region, which are likely related to reductions in sea ice in this area (Øigård  et al.  2013).   A small tourist industry that visits the whelping patches in the Gulf of St. Lawrence is not thought to pose any risk to the Seals; it uses a rotational mode of operation such that individual Seals are not visited repeatedly (Kovacs and Innes 1990).   Oil spills in the Northwest Atlantic off the east coast of Canada remain a threat to Seals. There is a concern about the impacts of tanker traffic, particularly in places like Lancaster Sound in the eastern Canadian Arctic, which is an important Harp Seal summering area (Reijinders  et al.  1993). The discharge from a ruptured tank on the shore of New Brunswick, Canada in March–April 1969 led to 10,000 to 15,000 Seals being heavily coated with oil. The high number of dead pups washing ashore after this event was evidence of the lethal effects of the oil (St. Aubin 1990). Oil development in the Barents Sea is ongoing and poses a future threat to Harp Seals in the White Sea and West Ice stocks.   Harp Seals have been found to carry significant loads of contaminants including metals, DDT and PCBs (Ronald  et al.  1984ab). Organochlorines are still present in their blood, despite DDT levels in the environment (and PCBs to a lesser extent) declining from the early 1970s to the 1980s (Addison  et al.  1984) and further in the 1990s and 2000s (Muir and de Wit 2010).   Phocine distemper virus (PDV) was first found in Harp Seals from the West Ice off Jan Mayen in 1987 and 1989. It is widespread in Harp Seals, but only shows up as antibodies; it is not known if there are significant health effects or mortality from PDV infection in this species (Daoust  et al.  1993, Duignan  et al.  1997). Harp Seals might have been the carriers responsible for the Harbour Seal PDV epidemic in Europe in 1988 (Markussen and Have 1992). PDV also appeared Harp Seals in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1991, but not in epidemic proportions (Daoust  et al.  1993).   Global climate warming is of notable concern for this species. There have already been major reductions in the extent and seasonal duration of sea ice cover in the Northern Hemisphere, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth  et al.  2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre  et al.  2008,&#160;Laidre&#160; et al. &#160;2015). Pinnipeds such as the Harp Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting and resting are likely to be heavily impacted by future changes in their sea ice habitats (Johnston  et al.  2005, Friedlaender  et al.  2007, Kovacs  et al.  2011,&#160;Kovacs&#160; et al.&#160; 2012). The high variability in pup production numbers in Canada, as well as the condition declines in the Northeast Atlantic, are thought to be linked to changing oceanographic and sea ice conditions. The degree of plasticity Harp Seals might show with respect to temporal or spatial shifts in breeding times and areas is not known.","5.4.2, 5.4.4",Pagophilus groenlandicus,mammals
41672,threats,"Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology in Baltic Seals (Bergman and Olsson 1986), and high concentrations of mercury in Saimaa Seals is thought to have reduced pup production in the 1960s and 1970s (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kostamo  et al . 2002). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment, contaminant levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo  et al . 2002). The same is true with regards to POPs in Arctic populations (Wolkers  et al . 2008). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seals. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively affected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).  Manipulation of water levels, recreational snow machine operation, net-fishing, boating, tourism, and development of cottages on the shoreline have been noted as threats to the Ringed Seals in Lake Saimaa, and industrial pollution, net fishing and poaching, as well as disturbance of on-shore summer haulout groups have been highlighted as threats for the Ladoga Seals (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Agafonova  et al . 2007). Predation by Red Fox, Wolves, feral and domestic Dogs, and even birds of prey, are also risks for these lake Seals (e.g., Kunnasranta  et al . 2001). By-catch in fisheries and other negative impacts associated with fisheries conflicts seem at present to be the major threat to Saimaa and Ladoga Seals (Kokko  et al . 1998, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Verevkin 2002, Sipilä 2003, Agafonova  et al . 2007).  Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat required for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth  et al . 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre  et al . 2008). Early break-up of the ice results in poor condition of pups and higher mortality rates (Smith and Harwood 2001). Associated changes in precipitation and weather patterns could also negatively affect Ringed Seal populations if there is insufficient snow cover to protect pups in lairs in the spring (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Ferguson&#160; et al . 2005, Kelly&#160; et al . 2010, Hezel&#160; et al . 2012, Iacozza and Ferguson 2014). Pups born outside lairs have a very low chance of survival; the pups are so small that even large Gulls can be predators if they are exposed (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Declining trends in reproduction and survival of pups have already been noted in some regions that have been attributed to earlier break-up of the sea ice over recent decades and concomitant changes in the marine ecosystem (Ferguson  et al . 2005, Stirling 2005). Reductions in arctic sea ice could have quite dramatic effects via prey availability if Polar and Arctic Cod populations are negatively impacted.    Reductions in sea ice cover will likely lead to increased human activity in arctic regions in the form of shipping and resource extraction industries, with associated increased threat of marine accidents and pollution discharge (Pagnan 2000). An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Ringed Seals, to abandon areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997) although studies to date suggest relatively minor impacts of development (Davis&#160; et al .&#160;1991; Moulton&#160; et al . 2002, 2003, 2005; Blackwell&#160; et al .&#160;2004). However, over-flights by aircraft certainly cause disturbance to Ringed Seals if flights occur by helicopter at less than 1,500 m distance or by fixed-winged aircraft at closer than 500 m (Born&#160; et al .&#160;1999).","5.4.2, 5.4.4",Pusa hispida,mammals
41673,threats,"Baltic Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from human industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology (Bergman and Olsson 1986). In samples collected in the early 1970s only 17% of Ringed Seal females were believed to be fertile (Helle 1980). Uterine occlusions were evident in a majority of studies which had severe implications since occluded uterine horns are dysfunctional for the rest of the animal's life (Bergman and Olsson 1986). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants into the environment, levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo  et al.  2002). Nevertheless, fertility rates of females are about 68% in the Bothnian Bay (HELCOM 2015), which is below rates found in some Arctic populations (Reeves 1998). No data on pregnancy are available from the southern Baltic subpopulations.  Up to the end of the 1990s, Ringed Seal pups died in drift nets set for Salmon, but this threat ceased after drift nets were banned in the Baltic. Ringed Seals are still caught in fyke nets, but the magnitude of this source of mortality is unknown (Härkönen pers. comm.).  Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seal populations. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively effected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).  Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat that they require for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth  et al.  2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre  et al.  2008).

Climate change impacts could be particularly acute for Ringed Seals living in restricted habitats such as the Baltic Sea (Meier  et al.  2004). Using climatological models forecasting changes in winter temperature up to year 2100, Sundqvist  et al.  (2012) showed that diminishing ice fields would likely contribute to extirpation of the southern Baltic Ringed Seal subpopulation in the Gulf of Riga and reduced growth rates in other subpopulations.

44166,threats,"The threat to Small-clawed Otter is similar to that of Smooth-coated and Eurasian otters. Throughout Asia the potential threat to its continued survival is destruction of its habitats due to changing land use pattern in the form of developmental activities. In many parts of Asia, the habitats have been reduced due to reclamation of peat swamp forests and mangroves, aquaculture activities along the intertidal wetlands and loss of hill streams. In India the primary threats are loss of habitats due to tea and coffee plantations along the hills, in the coastal areas loss of mangroves due to aquaculture and increased human settlements and siltation of smaller hill streams due to deforestation. Increased influx of pesticides into the streams from the plantations reduces the quality of the habitats. The threat posed by poaching is still very significant in many parts of India, and SE Asia and will certainly count as a major threat that needs to be constantly monitored. Poaching for pelt has been reported from across the Western Ghats in south India (Prakash  et al . 2012).  Another important threat to Asian Small-clawed Otter is reduction in prey biomass due to over-exploitation, which make its remaining habitats unsustainable. Pollution is probably the single most important factor causing decline in the population of many fish species (Dehadrai and Ponniah 1997). Reduction in prey biomass affects otter population, and organochloric and heavy metal contamination interferes with their normal physiology leading to the decline in population. The threats to Small-clawed Otter is prominent in its western range so much so that since last 60 years its range has shrunk considerable moving west to east from Himachal Pradesh to Assam (Hussain  et al . 2011).",5.4.4,Aonyx cinereus,mammals

61442,threats," Availability of prey likely has a strong influence on the Cook Inlet Beluga subpopulation (Moore  et al . 2000). Few data are available on prey abundance within their range except for the commercially harvested species of Pacific salmon. Speckman and Piatt (2000) speculated that availability of Beluga prey species may have changed in the lower Inlet as part of a general regime shift in the Gulf of Alaska. Local residents perceive that there was a general decline in the abundance of fish in Cook Inlet in the 1990s (Huntington 2000). A study of stable isotope ratios in individual GLGs of teeth representing the period from 1962 to 2007 found that the diet of the Cook Inlet Belugas had shifted over that period to more freshwater species (Nelson  et al . 2018). While this confirms a diet change it does not distinguish between a change in the fauna of Cook Inlet or a diet shift resulting from a change in distribution as the Cook Inlet Belugas have concentrated in the river mouths of the upper Inlet in recent years. It is possible, if not likely, that climatic warming has changed characteristics of the Cook Inlet environment and fauna in ways that affect Beluga Whales, but currently there are no data that can be used to evaluate such changes.    Shelden  et al . (2003) reviewed data on Killer Whale predation in Cook Inlet, and although they accounted for 21 Belugas killed between 1985 and 2002 the authors concluded that predation was a small contribution to overall mortality. More recent studies have concluded that predation by Killer Whales may be a significant source of mortality for Cook Inlet Belugas (Vos and Shelden 2005, Burek-Huntington  et al . 2015). Because this population is currently at a very low size, otherwise normal fluctuations in prey availability and predation may affect its ability to recover (Hobbs  et al . 2015b).&#160;&#160;    Other factors that could have an adverse effect on Cook Inlet Belugas include fishery interactions, contaminants and noise associated with oil and gas exploration and production, vessel traffic, and municipal activities such as waste management and urban runoff (Moore  et al . 2000, Norman  et al . 2015, NMFS 2003, 2016). The quality and quantity of data for describing impacts or predicting effects of such factors vary greatly. Levels of heavy metals, PCBs, and chlorinated pesticides are much lower in Cook Inlet Belugas than in other Beluga subpopulations in Alaska (Becker  et al . 2000). Observer programs and other reports indicate that current incidental take in commercial fisheries is very low (Moore  et al . 2000). The potential effects of anthropogenic noise on Cook Inlet Belugas has received substantial research effort (Lammers  et al . 2013, Castellotte  et al . 2014, 2016), however further investigation is required to quantify impacts and identify mitigation measures (Small  et al . 2017). Determining the impact of municipal discharges is difficult (Norman  et al . 2015), and data are not adequate to describe or predict the effects of an oil spill on Belugas. Nonetheless, the fact remains that Cook Inlet is no longer a remote, pristine area. Over 350,000 people live in the municipality of Anchorage and the two adjacent boroughs, and there are two large military bases in the area (NMFS 2003). An analysis by NMFS concluded that: ""A significant part of the habitat for this species has been modified by municipal, industrial, and recreational activities in Upper Cook Inlet"" (NMFS 2003). A number of other significant habitat modifications are likely to occur in the near future.    Random demographic, environmental, and genetic factors can accelerate or even cause the extinction of small populations. Catastrophic events such as mass die-offs due to stranding, disease, or acute exposure to toxic substances (e.g., oil spills) could push depleted populations of Belugas to extinction (O'Corry-Crowe and Lowry 1997, Hobbs  et al . 2015b). Mass strandings of Belugas are relatively common in the shallow tidal areas of upper Cook Inlet. Although most stranded individuals manage to swim away on the rising tide, some are known to die (Moore  et al . 2000, Burek-Huntington  et al . 2015). The viability of small populations is further compromised by the increased risk of inbreeding and the loss of genetic variability through drift, which reduces their ability to cope with disease and environmental change (Lacy 1997, O'Corry-Crowe and Lowry 1997). Estimates of genetic variation do not, at present, suggest that Cook Inlet Belugas are highly inbred or that a critical amount of genetic variation has been lost through drift (O'Corry-Crowe  et al . 1997, 2018), but this subpopulation is already in a size range where eventual loss of genetic variability is expected.",5.4.4,Delphinapterus leucas Cook Inlet subpopulation,mammals
63129,threats,"In Peru this species is probably grouped with  M. mento  and maybe  Triakis maculata  under the local name ""tollo"". The Peruvian tollo fishery probably consists mainly of  M. whitneyi . The abundance of  M. whitneyi  decreases towards the south, and consequently the Chilean tollo fishery probably catches mainly  M. mento , which has a more southern distribution. Thus the Peruvian fishery constitutes the main threat to  M. whitneyi .    In Peru, landings of tollo were high for a 24-year period between 1966 and 1989, averaging 11,276 t per year and reaching a peak of 25,000 t in 1984 (FAO 2006). From 1990 to 2004, there was a substantial drop in landings to an average of 4,806 t. The sharp decline in 1990 between two periods of relative stability is not a typical response to overfishing, indicating that landings may not be a good index of abundance. However, it is thought that the population did decline by an unknown extent during the 1990s, leading to a shift of fishing effort away from tollo. Furthermore, the implementation of a new minimum size regulation in 2001 may have also reduced catches. The effects of the new regulations are not yet known.    The Peruvian tollo fishery has shown remarkable productivity over a period of more than 30 years, but is probably now somewhat depleted.","5.4.2, 5.4.4",Mustelus whitneyi,sharks_and_rays

By 2003 the commercial trawl fleet had increased to about 400 shrimp trawlers operating on the continental shelf (Mendoza  et al.  2003).  In addition an artisanal fleet of 20,000 small vessels and about 1,000 medium and long-range vessels exists (Mendoza  et al.  2003). Bycatch taken by shrimp trawlers off Venezuela was estimated at 96,000 tonnes annually and bycatch/shrimp ratios are typically between 5 and 15:1 in the region (Charlier 2000). Charlier (2000) indicates that although only a small part of this catch is utilized, several species have apparently disappeared from the bycatch.    Overall temporal trends in reported catches for Venezuela showed a steep increase in landings through the 1980s and 1990s, from about 150,000 t/year to over 350,000 t/year (Mendoza  et al.  2003). Data reporting is poor in these artisanal fisheries and official catches for some species, in some areas or time-periods, may under-represent true catches by 200 to 500% (Medoza  et al.  2003).

Stocks of this species showed a strong reduction in the 1970s from global landings of 4,095,394 t in 1966, to 887,533 t in 1979. This decline was attributed to overfishing. Approximately 10-20% of these landings are taken from Area 21 (Northwest Atlantic) while the rest is taken in Area 27 (Northeast Atlantic). The largest reported catches are from Norway and Iceland. In the last 10 years global catches have shown an increase: 1998 - 2,421,462 t, 1999 -  2,411,408 t, 2000 - 2,381,011 t, 2001 -  1,952,605 t, 2002 - 1,873,503 t, 2003 - 1,958,929 t, 2004 - 2,020,111 t, 2005 - 2,316,050 t, 2006 - 2,244,595 t. While stocks hit critically low levels in the 1970s and showed signs of commercial extinction, they have since recovered (Melvin and Stephenson 2007).         The Northwest Atlantic stock is treated as two separate stocks: Gulf of Maine stock and Georges Bank-Nantucket Shoals stock. The Georges Bank stock crashed in the 1970s due to overexploitation by foreign fishers, while the Gulf of Maine stock continued to support coastal fisheries. The Georges Bank stock is now said to have fully recovered due to recolonisation from Gulf of Maine and Nantucket Shoals. The Bay of Fundy stock declined from approximately 570,000 mt in 1997 to 460,000 mt in 2000 - 2001, however in 2002/ 2003 it showed an increase (Melvin  et al.  2004; NOAA 2005). Despite this increase there are concerns about the stock due to fewer adults in the population.   Current rates of fishing mortality in the U.S. fisheries are calculated to be approximately 10% indicating that stocks are under-utilised, however there is concern that the inshore Gulf of Maine stock is being over-exploited (NOAA 2005).  An average fishing mortality (F) of 0.7 was calculated for the 1970s, this declined to 0.3 in the 1980s, 0.15 in 1991 and has since remained stable at 0.1 since 2002 (TRAC 2006).",5.4.2,Clupea harengus,clupeiformes

It is also a regular bycatch component in local and regional coastal trawl fisheries for shrimps and finfishes. (Cervigón  et al.  1992, McEachran and Carvalho 2002, M. Stehmann pers. obs.).  Fishing pressure on the inshore coastal environment is fairly intensive across large parts of this species' distribution, and its inshore coastal occurrence and low fecundity may make it susceptible to localised population reductions. Across Caribbean South America and parts of Brazil, trawling and inshore netting is intensive and this eagle ray is reported to be a regular bycatch of coastal trawl and other net fisheries in South America.  Snapper and grouper fisheries operate over extensive areas of the continental shelf and slope off Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname and French Guiana, although no information is available on bycatch (Mendoza  et al.  2003). Approximately 1,000 medium- and long-range vessels target snappers and groupers inside and outside the Venezuelan EEZ using handline and demersal longline gear (Mendoza  et al.  2003). Shrimp trawl fisheries are also intense in many parts of this region. For example, trawl fisheries began off northeastern Venezuela in the late 1960s, subsequently showing considerable increases in both effort and efficiency (Mendoza and Marcano 1994, Mendoza  et al . 2003). Overall temporal trends in total reported catches for Venezuela showed a steep increase in landings through the 1980s and 1990s; from about 150,000 t/year to more than 350,000 t/year (Mendoza  et al . 2003). Bycatch taken by shrimp trawlers off Venezuela was estimated at 96,000 tonnes annually and bycatch/shrimp ratios are typically between 5 and 15:1 in the region (Charlier 2000). Charlier (2000) indicates that, although only a small part of this catch is utilized, several species have apparently disappeared from the bycatch.

161439,threats,"Mobulid rays are taken by surface gill net, longline, purse seine and directed harpoons throughout much of their range, however detailed information on these fisheries is poorly documented (White  et al.  2006a).   Mobula kuhlii  is vulnerable to net gear, in particular gill nets, and is taken as a target or utilised bycatch in Indonesia and likely throughout much of its range. In Indonesia mobulid rays are landed as bycatch by artisanal gillnet fishers who target tuna. White  et al.  (2006a) conducted a study of the bycatch of mobulid rays in the drift gillnet fishery for skipjack tuna off Indonesia. Of 409 mobulid rays observed at four landing sites in eastern Indonesia from April 2001 to October 2005,  M. kuhlii  was the most rarely recorded and composed only 2% of the total rays, in this part of its range.  The high value of gill rakers in some areas is driving a dramatic increase in the catch of mobulids in Indonesia, where some fishers are now targeting devil rays, and their meat, cartilage and skin are also utilised (White  et al . 2006). Although specific catch details are unavailable because of poor documentation in fisheries, mobulid rays appear to be particularly susceptible to overfishing as their fecundity is the lowest of all elasmobranchs (with litter sizes of typically only one pup and a gestation period assumed to be 1–3 years) (White  et al.  2006a).  Directed mobulid fisheries have also been reported in other areas of this species’ range, including India, Sri Lanka and Thailand (Compagno and Last 1999, White  et al.  2006a). Given the vulnerable life-history characteristics of this species, it is highly unlikely to be able to sustain continued directed fishing. Manta rays were targeted in the Philippines until protection was introduced for them in this area in 1988, as a result of international concern for the sustainability of such fisheries (see Conservation Measures below) (White  et al.  2006a). Directed artisanal elasmobranch and ray fisheries using surface and bottom gillnet and line, also operate off Tanzania and a variety of artisanal multi-species artisanal net and line fisheries operate off South Africa (www.wiofish.org).Traditional fisheries for rays operate off Oman, using bottom lines and fixed gillnets. Rays are also often caught incidentally using beach seines off Oman (FAO 2008). Furthermore this species’ preference for coastal waters places it within the range of inshore fisheries, which are known to be intensive in many parts of its range, including India, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Indonesia (Young  et al.  2005, Flewwelling and Hosch 2006, Mngulwi 2006, Morgan 2006).  A recent review of the state of marine capture fisheries management in the Indian Ocean, noted that directed fisheries for sharks and rays exist in the Maldives, Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, South Africa and Tanzania and their status is considered probably fully to overexploited in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Young  et al.  2006). The same review noted that ‘Rays, stingrays, mantas nei’ (a catch category that includes mobulid rays) are moderately to fully exploited in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia (Young  et al.  2006). The life-history characteristics of this species, including very low fecundity, make it more vulnerable to exploitation relative to other more productive species of elasmobranchs included under these categories.  Mobulid rays are valuable for their branchial fiter plates, which are exported from Indonesia to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore and ground down for use in traditional Chinese medicines (White  et al.  2006a). The skins, cartilage and flesh are also utilised for human consumption and the cartilage also used as a ‘filler’ for low-grade shark fin soup (White  et al.  2006a).","5.4.2, 5.4.4",Mobula kuhlii,sharks_and_rays

They are also easily caught in coastal fisheries along the coast of western Africa, with purse-seines and gillnets (M. Ducrocq pers. obs. 2006). Rhinopterids have been heavily fished in areas along the western African coast and their aggregating habit makes them susceptible to capture in large schools. This species is most common in shallow waters on the continental shelf, where fishing pressure generally intensive. This species is important in fisheries landings in Mauritania, particularly in the trammel-net fishery (B. Séret, M. Ducrocq pers. obs.). Most individuals recorded in catches in the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin (PNBA) were immature and the species is still captured in gillnet fisheries targeting sciaenids there (PNBA unpublished database, M.

The Banc d'Arguin is threatened with overfishing, outside the Park, by international industrial-scale exploitation and by neighbouring pirate fishing fleets within it (UNEP-WCMC 2002).

161521,threats," Eastern Atlantic  The threat status of this species is of concern in the North Atlantic because of intensive fisheries operating on the deep slopes, following depletion of demersal fish stocks on the continental shelves and fishing-banks (Compagno in prep.). In the northeast Atlantic  C. fabricii  is frequently taken as bycatch in deepwater trawl and longline fisheries; however bycatch data is scarcely available.  ICES (2005) gives full description of the mixed trawl, deepwater gillnet and mixed and directed longline fisheries operating in the northeast Atlantic. Many of these fisheries operate throughout much of the species' geographic range in this area and bycatch pressure is likely to be significant. For example, off Iceland, a considerable amount of  C. fabricii , are likely to be discarded by the commercial fishery for Greenland halibut  Reinhardtius hippoglossoides . Records are rare and purely incidental, but Jakobsdottir (2001) estimated a bycatch of 98 and 109 t in 1996 and 1997 respectively based on trawl surveys in the area. Records of the catch proportions of the fleet in this area are needed for a full evaluation of the level of discarding of this species.   C. fabricii,  are landed by the French trawl fishery for mixed deep-water species. Initially this fishery was conducted in ICES sub-areas VIa, VIIc,k but in 2001 when the Irish deep-water trawl fishery started to operate in Subarea VII most of the French fishing fleet moved to Subarea VIa (ICES 2005). In sub-area  XII there have been some French landings of deep-water sharks, but it is not possible to detect any trends from the available data (ICES 2005). Note that this Sub-area contains both the western part of Hatton Bank and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ICES 2005) where this species is known to occur. Landings in France (mainly from division Vb and sub-area VI) decreased from about 250 t in 2000 to nearly 30 t in 2004 (ICES 2005). Iceland reported few landings from division Va and the largest annual landings reported by Spain came from sub-area XII in 2000 (85 Tonnes) and 2001 (91 tonnes) (ICES 2005).  Despite the more northerly distribution exhibited by this species, concerns still exist that this species will be vulnerable to the growing trend of the French deep-water trawl and other fisheries to operate in deeper waters to the west of the British Isles. Furthermore, there is still a lack of data available on incidental catches. Although  C. fabricii  has higher ovarian fecundities than other squalid sharks of its size, females still attain a large size at first maturity (Jones  et al.  2005), and therefore this species may also be subjected to overfishing by the deep-water fishery.  The species is occasionally taken as a bycatch off southern Africa, but generally occurs in deepwater beyond the hake fishery zone. The species is not considered to be threatened in this region; however the situation should be monitored if fisheries expand into deeper waters. There is little information on catches of this species in the eastern central Atlantic.   Western Atlantic  In the northwest Atlantic, the species is taken as bycatch in a number of fisheries. In Canadian waters, there is no directed fishery but  C. fabricii  are taken as bycatch in a number of fisheries, primarily the Greenland halibut  R. hippoglossoides , crab, redfish, monkfish and witch fisheries where removals averaged a total of 68t annually between 1996 and 2005 (Kulka 2006).  In the NRA, there are no data on removals but bycatch would be significant on the  R. hippoglossoides  fishing grounds (Kulka 2006). Based on distributional information, it is expected that most of the fish that would be captured in the fisheries in the NRA slope waters would be large juveniles or adults (Kulka 2006). Samples from the Russian  R. hippoglossoides  fleet in the NRA support this (Kulka 2006). Although incidental catch of this species in the NRA has not yet been quantified, recent population trends of adults have been stable (Kulka 2006).

This fishery has operated since the 1900s and targets a number of teleost species such as tiger flathead, jackass morwong, eastern school whiting, John Dory etc.  These target species are under quota management, but sustainable catch levels for Sydney skate will be much lower than for the more productive teleost species. Independent surveys off southern New South Wales show catch rates for ""skates"" combined have declined by 83% over 20 years (Graham  et al . 2001). Commercial trawling on the upper slope off NSW began in 1968 and by the early 1980s more than 100 trawlers between 15-25 m were operating off NSW, landing about 15,000 t of fish per year. About 60 of these trawlers regularly fished on the upper slope. By the end of the 1990s, the number of trawlers regularly fishing the NSW slope grounds had reduced to about 40 (Graham  et al.  2001).

In 2005, 29% of  Dipturus australis  were retained based on observer monitored catches (ISMP data) More recently, increasing management of major commercial species has resulted in fishers looking for alternate species to market, including skates and rays.

A study conducted in Florida reported that mean mercury concentrations in individuals of this species were within the range known to cause direct health effects in fish after long-term exposure, and concluded this could cause stress on their populations (Adams and Sonne 2013, Koenig and Coleman 2016). Another study conducted off Belize also found elevated levels of mercury (Evers  et al . 2009). Ongoing research on the impacts from high mercury concentrations indicate that older males in particular suffer liver damage and/or mortality, and that egg viability is reduced (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018). Another potential threat to the recovering population is inbreeding, and related genetics studies are currently in preparation for publication (C. Koenig pers. comm. 2018).

196056,threats,"This species is an important commercial species that is targeted along the southeastern coast of Japan. Because of the paucity of the local source of roast hagfish,  Paramyxine atami  sold in Teradomari near Niigata, a large amount of  M. garmani  were imported from Onahama (eastern Japan) to Teradomari  (western Japan) until 1994 in order to supplement the  Paramyxine  catch. However, the hagfish catch off Onahama declined rapidly, perhaps due to overfishing by Japanese and Korean boats off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture (Honma 1998). While catch data is mixed and reported as aggregate for Hagfish, the hag fishery in this region has declined both in terms of numbers of boats and in size of catch (Gorbman  et al . 1990, Honma 1998), but has increased in value.  Mixed hagfish landings data in this region between 1980 and 1995 shows a 70% decline in total hagfish catch (Gorbman  et al.  1990; Honma 1998) and effort has remained consistent through this period, likely as a result of low abundance levels.

Due to its likely shallow habitat, it may have been locally threatened by the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana and Alabama.

17367725,threats,"The reasons for the large declines in the Western Steller Sea Lion population are unclear, but they have been the subject of intensive and ongoing investigations. Deliberate killing by fishermen, disease, incidental take by fisheries, and reduced food supply have been suggested as factors that may have contributed to the decline (Lowry   et al.   1989, Loughlin and York 2000) but there is no evidence to suggest that intentional killing of Sea Lions currently occurs at any level that could be limiting recovery. In 2008, the US National Marine Fisheries Service released a Recovery Plan that identified and ranked threats to recovery using a weight of evidence approach to assess the relative impact (NMFS 2008). They recognized three threats as “potentially high”: environmental variability, competition with commercial fisheries, and Killer Whale predation. Atkinson   et al.   (2008) reviewed the suspected anthropogenic sources of mortality for Western Steller Sea Lions and concluded that competition with fisheries and the potential impacts of contaminants could not be excluded as continuing threats to recovery.",5.4.4,Eumetopias jubatus ssp. jubatus,mammals
22680409,threats,"     Levels of hunting in this species are poorly regulated in parts of the range and may be unsustainable in some areas. Two to five percent of the population has been harvested annually in Alaska and Canada in recent years (Powell  et al.  2012), accounting for 16,000 individuals (Rothe  et al . 2015). Harvesting levels can reach 6.9% in the Northwest Territories (Byers and Dickson 2001), while in south west Greenland there has been an estimate of between 10-20% of the winter population killed annually (Hansen 2002). No data is available for Russia. In one study covering the wintering population in southwest Greenland, 22% of adults carried embedded lead shots (Falk  et al.  2006). Lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead have also been detected in related Spectacled Eiders Somateria fischeri in Alaska where they are thought to be reducing survival rates (Grand  et al.  1998, Flint  et al.  2016). Given their overlapping ranges and similar ecologies, King Eiders are likely to be affected in a similar way.   The species is also vulnerable to mortality from bycatch, with 100-200 individuals killed per year around Nuuk, Greenland. Bycatch of all eider species has been reported in Newfoundland, Iceland, Norway, Germany and the Baltic Sea (Merkel 2004). Oil spills poses an additional threat, a small spill in the Pribilof Islands in 1997 caused high Eider mortality. Should an oil spill occur in the eastern Chukchi Sea, a primary staging area for King Eiders during autumn and spring migrations, it would be expected to cause a population decline of between 2.1-3.4% a year in northern Alaska (Bentzen and Powell 2012). Oil fields have been developed in areas where King Eider nests in northern Alaska, but no decline in numbers has been documented (Powell  et al.  2012), with pollution from spills being a greater threat than the disturbance of oil exploration activities and development of platforms. Climate change poses an ongoing and future threat to the species through ocean acidification and habitat shifting. Decreased pH values of seawater may lead to declines in molluscs which are key prey items in eider diets (Steinacher  et al . 2009, USFWS 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Remote sensing has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith  et al.  2005, Riordan  et al.  2006) which could constitute breeding habitat loss. However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been demonstrated. Climate change is still predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the sensitive Arctic region (Fox  et al.  2015), likely to alter the population dynamics of this high arctic species.      ",5.4.4,Somateria spectabilis,birds
22694296,threats," Population fluctuations are probably caused by the effects of El Niño Southern Oscillation, compounded by over-fishing, on prey abundance and consequently breeding success, and even adult survival (Velarde  et al.  1994, E. Velarde  in litt.  1998, Velarde 1999). During strong El Niño years breeding success collapses to near zero, in comparison to around 0.5 in a typical year, and individual female mass is greatly reduced (Case  et al.  2002).  About 90% of the global population exists on Isla Rasa, a basalt platform of 0.68 km2 and, as such, the occupied breeding range is very small. However, Isla Rasa was declared a sanctuary in 1964 (Anderson  et al.  1976), and has been well-managed during the breeding season by resident biologists, who discourage egg-collecting and disturbance (E. Velarde in litt. 1998, B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999). Commercial egg collection prior to the declaration of Isla Rasa as a sanctuary considerably reduced the population (Bowen  et al.  2015). Any weakening of protection on the island may see an increase in egg collection once again, and there is little protection for breeding attempts on other islands, though these are only a small percentage of the population. Introduced black rats  Rattus rattus  and house mice  Mus musculus  were eradicated from Isla Rasa in 1995, and reproductive success in Heermann’s Gulls doubled in the areas where rodents were previously most prevalent (Bowen  et al.  2015). It is likely that these invasive species impact breeding attempts on additional islands.         Heermann’s Gulls may be at risk from pollution, cadmium concentrations during two seasons were found to be above threshold levels for adverse impacts on reproduction and survival, and were the highest recorded in a study of 8 seabird species in coastal Sinaloa (Ceyca  et al.  2016). The impact of this contamination is currently unknown.&#160;   ",5.4.4,Larus heermanni,birds
22694552,threats," Declines in the fish stocks (e.g. sardines) due to overfishing, as well as fluctuations in stock due to El Niño events and sea surface temperature anomalies, cause dramatic fluctuations in the numbers of Elegant Terns, as well as large-scale migrations to new nesting sites. Previously, Elegant terns have shown high fidelity to breeding on Isla Rasa, with 90% of the population breeding on this island prior to 2000, even in adverse years. More recently there has been no successful nesting on Isla Rasa in 2003, 2009, 2010 or 2014 with each of these years being preceded by seasons of particularly high fishing effort. Warm sea surface temperature anomalies are thought to be the main factor determining the proportion of the tern population nesting away from Isla Rasa and the surrounding region, but fishing effort and total landings during the previous year also have a significant impact (Velarde  et al.  2015). Currently, when the sea surface temperature anomaly around Isla Rasa is over 1°C, more than 70% of total Elegant tern nesting population is observed in three Californian colonies, especially in San Diego, compared to less than 20% in years with a sea surface temperature anomaly of less than 1°C (Velarde  et al.  2015). Although human disturbance is not currently a significant threat to this species, as Elegant Terns move to nesting in more populated areas, such as San Diego, the impact of disturbance on nesting birds may increase.     Rats  Rattus  spp. were a problem on Isla Rasa until their successful eradication in 2009, upon which numbers of birds increased five-fold (Samaniego-Herrera  et al.  2011). Rats are unlikely to return to Isla Rasa, but as Elegant Terns move to new, less protected, breeding locations on mainland they may be vulnerable to future impacts of invasive species such as rats. Historically, the Isla Rasa colony was nearly eliminated by eggers. This became illegal in 1960s and ended early 1980s (Velarde  et al.  2015), as such, it is unlikely to return to Isla Rasa, but may pose a threat to new breeding colonies nesting in less well protected areas.

22694837,threats," As Little Auks spend much of their life at sea, including at and below the sea surface, they are vulnerable to both oil spill events and chronic oil pollution (Fort  et al.  2013). The Newfoundland area is subject to chronic oil pollution, with tens of thousands of Little Auks dying in this area annually (Wiese and Robertson 2004). Recent tracking research has indicated that important foraging grounds for the species overlap with expanding oil and gas extraction activities and shipping, which could lead to habitat degradation and species mortality (Fort  et al.  2013). The Little Auk is still hunted in Thule during its short period of presence in the summer, to form the delicacy Kiviaq, now only eaten at important celebrations. It is thought that, in the 1990s, annual take in Greenland was c. 60,000 birds which, due to the global population numbering over 30 million, is not thought to cause significant declines. There is also evidence for mortality due to bycatch, however, estimates for the combined bycatch of all auk species in the Northeast Atlantic is in the thousands (Fangel  et al.  2015), so this is unlikely to be causing declines.    It has been found that Little Auks’ reproductive output and body condition is unaffected by the retreat of sea-ice, due to the use of bathymetric features for foraging, meaning this species will be largely unaffected by the retreat of sea-ice in response to climate change. Further research shows Little Auks are able to switch to feeding in nutrient rich coastal glacier melt-water in cases where sea-ice is absent, maintaining chick growth but showing a 4% decrease in adult body mass (Grémillet  et al.  2015). There is some dispute as to whether changing sea surface temperature will have an effect on the Little Auk. It has been found that foraging plasticity allows Little Auks to feed on the smaller and less lipid-rich copepods found in warmer water without a reduction in fledging success or adult body condition, although this is thought to be at the expense of energy expenditure on other activities (Grémillet  et al.  2012). In contrast to this, Hovinen  et al.  (2014) found adult survival to be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation index and local summer sea surface temperatures with a time lag of 2 and 1 years respectively, implying climate change may have a negative effect on the Little Auk population.

22696810,threats," Several threats result from the seabird-fishery interactions, including bycatch, resource competition and direct persecution. The global extent of bycatch has not been quantified, but is thought to affect a majority of the population. When Ayala (2012) interviewed 59 fishermen working in the Peruvian anchovy fishery in 2009, 54% of them mentioned seabird bycatch, of which 10% listed Guanay Cormorant among the encountered species. Mangel (2012) reports that Guanay Cormorants and White-chinned Petrels  Procellaria aequinoctialis , made up the majority of total bycatch in Peruvian surface driftnet fishery (targeting sharks and rays). The Guanay Cormorant preys almost exclusively on anchovies (Tovar and Guillén 1987, Barbraud  et al . 2017) and is therefore vulnerable to competition for food with the industrial fishery, resulting in food limitation. Barbraud  et al . (2017) found that the proportion of anchovy biomass removed by fishing is negatively correlated to the abundance of Guanay Cormorants. Direct persecution for consumption still represents a threat with around 20,000 birds taken annually in Northern Peru (P. Majluf  in litt.  2007).    Climatic fluctuations associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also threaten the species. The 1982-83 El Niño caused total reproductive failure and the death of an estimated 1.7 million adult birds in study sites on the Peruvian coast, resulting in a sharper population decline than any of the other studied species (Tovar and Guillén 1987). Communal diving behaviour and the need to exploit large water columns simultaneously may explain why the impacts of El Niño are particularly severe for this species (Weimerskirch  et al . 2014). ENSO is a naturally occurring phenomenon and population recovery following previous declines suggest the species has a certain capacity to cope with periodical population crashes (Orta  et al . 2018). However, the frequency of ENSO events is expected to increase in concord with future climate change (Timmermann  et al . 1999) and adverse climatic conditions operating in synergy with an intensified industrial fishery and compromised food availability could exhaust the species’ adaptive capacity.    Extensive guano mining in the 19th century caused severe population declines through high levels of constant disturbance, habitat conversion and direct exploitation (Orta  et al . 2018). Unrestrained guano extraction on breeding islands displaced large numbers of birds and caused the loss of entire colonies. Exploitation of guano is still ongoing, but at a much smaller scale and within regulatory frameworks (Duffy 2000).   ",5.4.4,Leucocarbo bougainvilliorum,birds
22696907,threats,"The effects of introduced species on Chatham and Pitt Islands are not known, with birds tending to nest in inaccessible sites. Some nests, however, could be affected by Feral Cats  Felis catus ,&#160;Black Rats  Rattus rattus , Brown Rats  R. norvegicus,&#160; Common Brushtail Possum  Trichosurus vulpecula&#160; and Weka  Gallirallus australis  (Taylor 2000, Bell 2015). Birds are sometimes illegally shot by fishermen (Heather and Robertson 1997, Taylor 2000). A total of 40-80 birds may be caught in crayfish pots annually (Bell and Bell 2000), but changes to fishing practice may have reduced bycatch (Bell 2012). Recent declines could be a response to changes in the marine environment that are affecting food supplies (Bester and Charteris 2005). The species is potentially threatened by climate change because of its geographically bounded distribution to islands with a maximum altitude of 283 m (Birdlife International unpublished data).  ",5.4.4,Phalacrocorax featherstoni,birds
22697619,threats," During El Niño events, the species normally deserts its breeding grounds, causing total mortality of eggs and chicks, and undertakes extensive southward movements in search of food and better environmental conditions (Murphy 1925, Tovar  et al.  1987 and Duffy 1990 in Jeyasingham  et al.  2013). A meta-analysis of past El Niño events affecting Peruvian guano birds revealed average population declines of 17%, and 35% desertion of nesting areas (Duffy 1983). During the less frequent but more severe events (recognisable at c. 12-year intervals), mean population declines of 47% were recorded along with complete nesting failure (Duffy 1983).  Large-scale harvesting of aquatic resources have caused dramatic declines in abundance in the past by limiting prey availability, especially due to competition with the fishery for anchovies (Jahncke  et al.  2004). Bycatch of pelicans by small-scale subsistence fishermen is an ongoing threat, but only affects a minority of the population and has negligible effects on its abundance (Jahncke  et al.  2001).

22697758,threats,"The current global population is exhibiting a net increase, while that portion in the northern Antarctic Peninsula is beginning to stabilize after decades of significant decrease (Fountain  et al.  2016). Computer modelling work suggests that these trends will continue in the near term but net population change may reverse in the future if climate change continues on its current track. An analysis carried out by Ainley  et al.  (2010) suggests that all colonies north of 67-68°S could be lost by the time that Earth's average tropospheric temperature reaches 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with negative impacts on all colonies north of 70°S, despite limited growth south of 73°S. In this study, 2042 is the median year (range 2025-2052) at which a 2°C warming is predicted, based on the four climate models in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) that most closely replicate recent environmental conditions and trends in the Southern Ocean (Ainley  et al.  2010). Colonies experiencing novel conditions due to increased sea surface temperature were found to be declining or to have an unknown trend, strongly supporting ongoing environmental changes as a driver of population decline in the species (Cimino  et al.  2016). Furthermore, annual migration and winter survival may be negatively affected by decreases in sea ice coverage at northern latitudes (Ainley  et al.  2010, Ballard  et al.  2010, Hinke  et al.  2014). However, a simple latitudinal gradient in sea ice loss is unlikely, as warming so far has been regional in the Antarctic (Zwally  et al.  2002, Turner  et al.  2009, Trathan  et al.  2011, Fretwell  et al.  2012). During the summer, nesting habitat could be affected by an increase in the incidence of severe snowfall (Fraser  et al.  2013). On the basis of this and more recent (Cimino  et al.  2016) modelling work, as well as continued revelations concerning climate change (e.g. Fraser  et al . 1992, 2013, Trathan  et al.  2015), it will be vital to periodically review population responses to ongoing climate variability and change. Flightlessness and proximity to Antarctic stations and associate traffic makes the species susceptible to pollution (Culik  et al.  1991) and has previously suffered mortality from oiling, with the 1989 Bahia Paraiso oil spill near Palmer (Culik  et al.  1991) estimated to have killed 16% of local penguins. The risk of future spills remains, with potential for similar local scale impacts (J. Croxall  in litt.  2017).  The location of research stations near colonies has also led to reductions in suitable ground for breeding, excessive visits to colonies and disturbance caused by aircraft movements (del Hoyo  et al.  1992), although the impact of disturbance in relation to environmental conditions appears to vary with location (Bricher  et al.  2008) and only impacts a small minority of sites. Human impacts potentially include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries, particularly those targeting Antarctic krill. Harvesting of krill could be a threat, if management does not adequately take into account the needs of species that feed upon krill (Agnew 1997). However, relevant (overlapping) fisheries are CCAMLR-regulated and unlikely to overlap with a majority of the population (J. Croxall  in litt.  2017). Protection of habitat on land and at sea remains important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging and rafting areas at sea.",5.4.4,Pygoscelis adeliae,birds
22697761,threats,"Climate change is potentially the greatest threat to this species at present and in the future. It is thought to impact reproductive success through incurring changes in abundance and distribution of krill (Trivelpiece  et al.  2011, Clucas  et al.  2014), though these effects have been noted only in parts of the range (Lynch  et al.  2016). Changes in krill biomass and availability resulting from habitat shifts are thought to be driving rapid declines at a number of colonies (Barbosa  et al.  2012, Lynch  et al.  2012, Naveen  et al.  2012, Dunn  et al.  2016). In addition, there is considerable overlap between the expanding krill fishery and the species’s foraging distribution, hence there is potential for resource competition, potentially aggravating the climatic effects on krill availability (Hinke 2017).  Volcanic activity during the 2016 moulting season at Zavodovski and Bristol in the South Sandwich Islands could have had severe impacts on the large colonies residing there, and surveys of the breeding colonies at the South Sandwich Islands should be repeated. If large numbers are found to have been killed by the volcanic event, and if declines elsewhere on the Antarctic Peninsula continue, the species may warrant uplisting.  Human impacts potentially include disturbance from tourists, scientists, construction of new science facilities and fisheries. However, only a very small percentage of the global population is exposed to human intrusion and there is currently no documented evidence of population-level impacts (J. Croxall  in litt.  2017).",5.4.4,Pygoscelis antarcticus,birds
22697782,threats,"The main threats are commercial fisheries, oceanographic changes, and oil spills (Mattern 2013). The Snares Islands are the site of a large squid fishery, which affects the Snares Penguin through resource competition (Ellis  et al.  1998; Crawford  et al.  2017) while bycatch in set net fisheries is also a known source of mortality (Crawford  et al.  2017). Both of these threats have the potential to drive significant declines, but do not seem to be doing so at present.  There are no introduced predators on the Snares Islands and consequently the possibility of the accidental introduction of mammals is a continual concern (Mattern 2013). The probability of colonisation is low due to the biosecurity measures in place and rats or mice, the most likely species to colonise appear to have minimal impact on other  Eudyptes  species. However, other members of the genus in the region have undergone considerable long-term declines ( E. sclateri ,  E. chrysocome ), perhaps due to oceanic warming and the associated change in distribution of prey species (Ellis&#160; et al. 1998, Morrison&#160; et al.&#160; 2015), hence continued monitoring of the population is essential.

22697847,threats,"The Yellow-billed Loon is harvested for subsistence in Alaska, and a record of c.1,000 individuals taken in the Bering Sea region in 2007 indicates that this may pose the greatest threat to the species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009, M. Kirchhoff  in litt.  2010). More recently, however, other approaches to quantify loon harvest have come up with figures of 5 birds annually in 2011 and 2012 (Naves and Zeller 2017). Although this species is vulnerable to oil spills, its very large range means it is unlikely that a large proportion of the global population will be affected by any single event. Mercury or other heavy metal contamination pose a potential threat, particularly for birds wintering on the Asian side of the Pacific where feather and egg mercury concentrations considerably above background levels have been recorded (Evers  et al.  2014). There is some competition with fisheries for food, however, this only impacts a small percentage of the global population. Threats are exacerbated by a low reproductive rate and very specific breeding habitat requirements (K. Laing  in litt.  2008, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009).  ",5.4.4,Gavia adamsii,birds
22698030,threats," Invasive mammals such as cats, rats, goats and dogs are thought to threaten this species. Feral cat  Felis catus &#160;predation has been documented and is thought to be causing population decline, with a preliminary estimate of 2-3% annual adult mortality from cat predation (Hodum 2009). Additionally, feral cats prey on near-fledging chicks when they are on the surface exercising their flight muscles, although predation rates have not been quantified (Hodum 2009). Brown rats  Rattus norvegicus  also prey on chicks, though the incidence appears low and restricted to certain habitat types (J. C. Torres-Mura  in litt . 1999, P. Hodum  in litt . 2007). There is also limited evidence of predation on chicks by House Mice  Mus musculus , but this does not appear to be widespread (Hodum 2009). Dogs also depredate the species. Goat impacts include habitat alteration through native plant consumption and also, at times, direct collapses of burrows (Hulm 1995, J. C. Torres-Mura  in litt.  1999, P. Hodum  in litt . 2007, J. C. Torres-Mura  in litt . 2007, Hodum 2009). Despite attempts to reduce the goat population, it remains high (P. Hodum&#160; pers. obs .). Cows may also have a similar effect.    Flash flooding in 2002 caused severe localised habitat loss with an estimated 30,000 burrows destroyed (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). In 1995, a fire destroyed habitat at the edge of the principal colony and directly killed thousands of birds (J. C. Torres-Mura  in litt . 1999, P. Hodum  in litt.  2007).    Light pollution also represents a threat. On overcast nights, especially those with poor visibility due to rain and/or drizzle, lights in the village attract birds, occasionally causing collisions with structures in the village (Hodum 2009). The village is inhabited from September to May, during the period of lobster harvesting (P. Hodum  in litt . 2007).   The species is potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its altitudinal distribution, currently a range of approximately 500 m, falls entirely within 2,000 m of the highest mountain top within its range (1,649 m). Shifts in oceanic currents are ongoing, but their impacts are unclear for this species.  ",5.4.4,Pterodroma externa,birds
22698042,threats," This species is at risk from flooding due to heavy rains and the flooding of burrows represented the main cause of breeding failure on Lord Howe Island in the 2000 and 2001 breeding seasons (Bester  et al . 2007). Although flooding is unlikely to kill adult birds, it kills eggs and chicks through chilling and can weaken burrows, causing them to collapse (Bester  et al . 2007).    The native Lord Howe Woodhen is known to prey on eggs and young chicks and is known to be a significant source of nesting mortality (Bester  et al . 2007). Wedge-tailed Shearwaters are also problematic, known to evict smaller petrels from burrows, they have been seen to kill chicks in the small population on Phillip Island (Priddel  et al.  2010). Invasive and introduced species have also been a problem in the past, however, wild pigs, cats and goats have been successfully eradicated from Lord Howe Island (Department of the Environment and Energy 2015). Rat predation accounts for a small proportion of breeding failures each year (Bester  et   al . 2007). The rat population on Lord Howe is being controlled by baiting, with some plans to eradicate them in the future. If rat eradication does occur, introduced masked owls may switch to preying on petrels, potentially causing problematic declines (Bester  et al.  2007), for this reason there are plans for the eradication of this species on Lord Howe (Milledge  et al.  2010).   The Providence Petrel is at risk from drowning due to entrapment in fishing gear, however, this is not thought to be a significant source of mortality (Bester  et al . 2007). Hunting is known to have severely affected the Norfolk Island population in the past, possibly causing its extirpation (Medway 2002), but is thought to be unlikely to return. Plastic ingestion may also represent a threat, with plastic found in the stomachs of over 10% of the birds sampled (Bester  et al.  2010), however, this is not known to have any adverse consequences.

22724845,threats," The species is highly susceptible to bycatch in fishing nets and is likely to be also caught in derelict fishing gear as observed for other scoter species (e.g. Good  et al.  2009). The species may also suffer from resource competition with commercial fisheries exploiting marine benthic organisms and shellfish (Kear 2005).    Climate change is expected to impact this species in a number of ways. Remote sensing has shown the shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in Siberia which provide important breeding grounds for this species (Smith  et al.  2005). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox  et al.  2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration has been linked to declining Scoter populations in North America and this is likely due to trophic mismatch, so may also affect Siberian populations (Drever  et al.  2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Siberian Scoter diet (Steinacher  et al.  2009, del Hoyo  et al.  2017).    During moulting and winter aggregations, the species is highly susceptible to oil spills and other marine pollutants (del Hoyo  et al.  1992, Kear 2005) and one catastrophic oil spill could potentially destroy a large proportion of the global population if it occurred in a key moulting or wintering area (Madge and Burn 1988). Oil and gas exploration is a pervasive threat in the Arctic and is likely to increase in the future (Poland  et al . 2003, Henderson and Loe 2014), with human exploitation of natural resources in the taiga and lower tundra regions of its breeding range causing habitat degradation (Kear 2005).     The footprint of large offshore wind farms may exclude Siberian Scoter from some foraging areas and through disturbance, as it does reduce duck densities more than other seabird groups (Garthe and Hüppop 2004, Stewart  et al.  2007), however the impact on other scoter species appears minor and the majority of the Siberian Scoter's range does not have any current plans for large-scale wind farms. Collision mortality is also likely to be a minor threat as collisions rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared with other species groups, which is consistent with their high avoidance rates at offshore wind farms (Fox  et al.  2015).     There is a small risk that future outbreaks of H5N1 (avian influenza) could pose a risk to the species (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is mostly asymptomatic in wild birds and there is no record of significant mortality in this species.          ",5.4.4,Melanitta stejnegeri,birds
22724879,threats," Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten this species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while development associated with oil drilling sites can cause additional, low-level impacts through human disturbance and the degradation of food resources (Gorski  et al.  1977, Nikolaeva  et al.  2006). Some large populations border oil fields and proximity to drilling and transport puts the population at high risk of oil pollution (Nikolaeva  et al.  2006). However, one study found that although the 1996 Sea Empress oil spill in Carmarthen Bay resulted in a rapid and drastic reduction in Common Scoter numbers in the area, complete recovery occurred after three winters with no observable long-term effects (Banks  et al . 2008).    Climate change is thought to negatively impact the species at present and in the future through habitat loss and ecosystem degradation. Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for this species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes in Siberia (Smith  et al.  2005). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox  et al.  2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever  et al.  2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher  et al . 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Eutrophication in the Baltic Sea resulting from agricultural run-off, could also cause the loss of key prey items, e.g. bivalves (Skov  et al.  2011).   The risk of bycatch is thought to affect a majority of the population, as reported in the Gulf of Gdańsk (Stempniewicz 1994), and the commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat, through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Further threats to food resources include the loss of benthic habitats caused by sand and gravel extraction, although Skov  et al.  (2011) suggest that in the present-day Baltic region, this is occurring at insufficient levels to be responsible for declines in waterbirds. Hunting is contributing to mortality in some parts of the species’ range, but not thought to drive significant population decline. In Denmark, c.2,800-5,200 Common Scoters are harvested per year (Bregnballe  et al.  2006) but no data is available for other countries, although hunting of Common Scoters is legal in some EU countries (HELCOM 2013b). Interaction with wind farms could pose a potential threat to the species. While Stewart  et al . (2007) showed that duck densities were more adversely affected by wind farms than other groups of species, Dürr (2013) found the opposite, stating that collision rates between ducks and wind turbines are low compared to other species groups. Avian influenza is present in the population, but as yet there is no evidence that it has caused significant mortality events (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gudmundsson  et al.  2010). High-speed ferries have been suggested as a major cause of Common Scoter disturbance by a study in the Kattegat Sea, Denmark (Larsen and Laubek 2005).      ",5.4.4,Melanitta nigra,birds
22732425,threats," Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions have been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever  et al.  2011), and future ocean acidification may lead to sustained declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher  et al.  2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten the species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while oil drilling sites could also cause low-level impacts through human disturbance and degradation of food resources (Gorski  et al.  1977, Nikolaeva  et al.  2006). In parts of the range, avoidance of busy shipping areas by flocks of the species could displace flocks from preferred feeding areas. Hunting represents another threat to the species, with an average of 9,500 birds reported to be shot annually in the US and an additional 7,000 per year in Canada through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the actual number killed may have been much higher with maximum estimates exceeding 24,000 in the US in 1974 and 23,000 annually in Canada between 1974 and 1982 (Bordage and Savard 2011). Since this period, numbers of hunters have decreased considerably and the annual harvest has fallen concomitantly. The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is unlikely to affect the majority of the population at once and only small numbers of birds tested in various countries have developed the disease despite evident exposure to the virus. High-speed ferries can cause disturbance to this species (Larsen and Laubek 2005). In some areas, the breeding habitat is threatened by eutrophication from agricultural nutrient loads (Kear 2005).      ",5.4.4,Melanitta americana,birds
22734194,threats," Hunting poses a significant threat to the species, with an estimated harvest of 6,000 – 14,000 individuals in the 10-year period from 2004-2014 in US and Canada, but with a downward trend (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). A recent estimate suggests that the harvest of White-winged Scoters may be 29-37% over the maximum sustainable rate (Koneff  et al.  2017).    The species feeds at depths of 30–40 m and is therefore highly susceptible to bycatch in fishing nets, as documented by Good  et al.  (2009) in the Salient Sea, Washington. Moulting and wintering populations are also vulnerable to oil spills as they often occur in high densities in close proximity to oil transportation routes. One catastrophic spill could impact a large proportion of the population. Oil pollution can also cause the long-term disruption of food supplies which may have more serious effects on populations in the long-term than direct mortality from oiling. Lance (2001) documented evidence for a long-term negative effect as a result of the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident. The disturbance and habitat degradation caused by increasing levels of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic will likely have only minor or negligible impacts on this species (Poland  et al.  2003, Henderson and Loe 2014).     In some locations in the Pacific Northwest, sea ducks could be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium associated with mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, which raises the possibility that such exposure could be contributing to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). Climate change is an additional threat, with remote sensing showing the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska (Riordan  et al.  2006), with these wetlands providing important breeding grounds for the species at present. In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox  et al.  2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch, projected to cause a 31.0% population decline between 1980 and 2080 (Drever  et al.  2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of White-winged Scoter diet (Steinacher  et al.  2009, del Hoyo  et al.  2017).         ",5.4.4,Melanitta deglandi,birds
62030590,threats,"Reduction in discards from fisheries has greatly reduced available food in parts of the species range that had seen rapid increases in the previous century. Egging continues to the present day in rural parts of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and by indigenous people from Alberta to Labrador but rates are thought to be unlikely to be driving declines (Nisbet  et al . 2017). Control programmes are in place at many airports, to prevent damage to aircraft, but the impact is not thought to be significant (Nisbet  et al . 2017). The closely related European Herring Gull, ecologically and behaviourally equivalent, was the most frequently recorded casualty to collisions with wind turbines in a study of 4.7 km of the English coastline over 11 years (Newton and Little 2009). It is also likely to experience a change in suitable habitat due to the effects of climate change however, the effect of this is not currently known.      ",5.4.4,Larus smithsonianus,birds
62030608,threats," The species is at risk from reductions in food supplies due to changes in fishing practices. Reduction in discards has greatly reduced available food in parts of the species range that had seen rapid increases in the previous century. Further, trophic shifts have impacted fishing activity and catch size, which appears to be directly related to colony reproductive success: lower catches are resulting in lower breeding success and the decline of colonies in the UK (Foster  et al.  2017). The species is also vulnerable to collisions with wind turbines (Bradbury  et al.  2014) was the most frequently recorded casualty in a study of 4.7 km of the English coastline over 11 years (Newton and Little 2009). In the past, persecution has represented a significant source of mortality however, the EU directive (2009/147/EC) has made it an offence to kill birds or destroy eggs without license. This has likely resulted in a reduction in mortality due to persecution, however, there is still some level of culling, with 5,000 birds culled under license 2010-12 in the UK (Coulson 2015). The threat is unlikely to disappear, with recent paper calling for lethal controls for closely related  Larus &#160;spp. in Gulf of Maine (Scopel and Diamond 2017) however, this is thought to cause negligible declines. Botulism reports have been increasing in Britain in last 45 years and, despite the number of deaths not having been quantified, it is suggested to have been a factor in the population declines in Britain (Coulson 2015).

98471289,threats,"This species, similar to the other species of  Clupeonella , has suffered severe declines in recent years and faces several distinct threats, including impacts from invasive species, fishing pressure and habitat changes (i.e., increased sea level). The accidental introduction of the comb jelly  Mnemiopsis leidyi  from  the Azov-Black Sea Basin in 1999 is a major threat to this  species as they compete for the same food and  M. leidyi  also consumes the eggs of this species (Kideys  2001,    Shiganova  et al.  2004, Mamedov 2006, Fazli  et al.  2017).    This  species was the first Kilka to suffer from the introduction, which was  the main commercial species for all Caspian countries (Shiganova  et al.  2004).

It has been suggested that the reason for the 2005 stock collapse is primarily  due to the invasion and spread of this ctenophore species ( Mnemiopsis leidyi )  but that over-fishing and other factors also contributed to the crash (Fazli  et al.  2007, Daskalov and Mamedov 2007, Aliasghari  et al.  2017).
